# 1. Create Your Environment

## Overview

A collator deploys its node on a remote server. You can choose your preferred provider for dedicated servers and operating system. Generally speaking, we recommand you to select a provider/server in your region, this will increase decentralization of the network.
You can choose your preferred operating system, though we highly recommend Linux.

:::tip
Shibuya is the perfect network to test out your knowledge about running nodes in the Astar ecosystem. To join the collator set on Shibuya you need to apply for a 32k SBY fund.

If you never operated a collator node, we strongly encourage you to spin up a **Shibuya collator** node to start before thinking about the mainnet.
