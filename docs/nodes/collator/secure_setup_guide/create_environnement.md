# 1. Create Your Environment

## Overview

A collator usually deploys nodes on remote servers. You can choose your preferred provider for dedicated servers and operating system. You will find our recommendations on this page.

## Hardware requirements

We will provide a basic configuration for reference, which guarantees that all blocks can process in time. If the hardware is inferior to that, there will be malfunctions.

**Mainnet minimum requirements:**

- System: Ubuntu 20.04
- A dedicated server dedicated to the collator node
- CPU: 8 cores
- Memory: 16 GB
- Hard Disk: 400 GB SSD (storage space will increase with time)

**Basic minimum testnet configuration:**

- System: Ubuntu 20.04
- CPU: 4 cores
- Memory: 8 GB
- Hard Disk: 100 GB (storage space will increase with time)

:::tip
Shibuya is the perfect network to test out your knowledge about running nodes in the Astar ecosystem. To join the collator set on Shibuya you need to apply for a 32k SBY fund.

If you never operated a collator node, we strongly encourage you to spin up a **Shibuya collator** node to start before thinking about the mainnet.
