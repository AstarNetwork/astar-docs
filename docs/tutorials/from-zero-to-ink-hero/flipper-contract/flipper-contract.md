| Tutorial                                                                   | Difficulty                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| [NFT contract with PSP34](../nft/nft.md)              | Intermediate ink! -  Basic Rust       |          
| [Implement Uniswap V2 core DEX](../dex/dex.md) | Advanced ink! - Basic Rust |

### To follow this tutorial you will need:
- To [set up your ink! environment](/docs/build/environment/ink_environment.md).
- Basic Rust knowledge. [Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn).

### What will we do?
In this tutorial we will implement the most basic contract: [Flipper](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/v4.0.0/examples/flipper/lib.rs) in ink!.

### What will we use?
- [ink! 4.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/v4.0.0)

### What will you learn?
- Anatomy of an ink! contract
- Define contract storage
- Callable functions
- Unit test your contract
