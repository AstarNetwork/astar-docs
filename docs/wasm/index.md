# Wasm

The **Wasm** section covers the Wasm stack on Astar/Shiden, some more advanced topics, and contains a few tutorials to help you build and deploy Wasm smart contracts.

If you would like to start building right away, we encourage you to check out [**Swanky Suite**](sc-dev/swanky) - The all-in-one tool for Wasm smart contract developers within the Polkadot ecosystem.
