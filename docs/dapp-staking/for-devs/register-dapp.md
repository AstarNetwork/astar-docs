# Register dApp

How to register your dApp in our dApp staking mechanism. First, you have to make sure that you meet the [requirements](https://docs.astar.network/docs/dapp-staking/for-devs/requirements). **dApp staking is for all live projects in our ecosystem.** To receive support, the fastest way is to contact a member of [SpaceLabs](https://astar.network/spacelabs/).

:::info
- To register a dApp, you need to have 100 SDN or 1000 ASTR tokens + gas fee in your developer's wallet. On our testnet Shibuya you also need to have 100 SBY tokens.
- Create/import your developer's wallet in the Polkadot JS extension.
:::

## Step 1

Deploy a smart contract in our ecosystem and verify the contract in our explorer. Deploy on Shiden if you want to join Shiden dApp staking, deploy on Astar for joining Astar dApp staking. You have two options for a smart contract:

:::info
- The first option is to use one of your own smart contracts and verify that in our explorer.
- The second option is only for those who don't deal with smart contracts. Deploy our `helloworld.sol` contract and provide all the information in the header of the contract. [Template contract](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/builders-program/blob/main/hellowold.sol)

## Step 2

Go to our [portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/store/discover-dapps) and click on `+ Register dApp`:

Provide all the information in the pop-up window and press register. Keep in mind that your account needs to be **approved first**, and you have the needed tokens in the wallet that is registering the dApp.

When your dApp is deployed, we would appreciate it if you shared this with your community. We have created a template that you can use to write the article. You can find it [here](https://astarnetwork.notion.site/dApp-staking-template-Astar-Network-07d029f2d89644f48a17650522968682).
