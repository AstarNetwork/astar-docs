**The Rewards Panel**: 
- **Total Staked**: Total amount of $ASTR tokens you have staked.
- **Available to claim**: The unclaimed ERAs - It is recommended to claim frequently.
- **Re-Stake after claiming**: When turn this feature on, your rewards will automatically re-staked after you claim the unclaimed ERAs (more info about the [Re-Stake](compound-rewards) feature).
- **Total Earned (all-time)**: This is total rewards you have received from staking.  

**Unbonding Panel:**

The unbonding panel is where you can see the progress of unbonding and withdraw. Once itâ€™s unbonding we cannot know which dApp you have unbonded from but remain as `Chunks`. There is a unbonding period of 10 ERAs for Astar and 5 EARs on Shiden. After you have unstaked and when those ERAs pass, you will be able to withdraw. More information about [Unbonding](unbonding).
