### Manage dApp Staking

Once you have staked, new options to manage your dApp staking will appear on “My Staking Panel”.

My Rewards Panel where you can see your status of your rewards : 

**Total Staked**: Total amount of ASTR tokens you have staked.

**Available to claim**: The unclaimed eras - It is recommended to claim friquently around once a week.

**Re-Stake after claiming**: When turn this feature on, your rewards will automatically re-staked after you claim the unclaimed eras(so you would have to claim by yourself).

**Total Earned(all-time)**: This is total rewards you have received from staking.
