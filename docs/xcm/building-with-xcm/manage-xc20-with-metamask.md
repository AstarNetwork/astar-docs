As you can see in the screenshot above, we have DOT assets in our EVM wallet. Now let's add the asset to our MetaMask.

### Import assets on MetaMask

Open your MetaMask and connect your wallet with DOT assets. Make sure you are connected to the Astar Network. If not, you can find all [Network Details here]().

When you are connected you can import tokens into your wallet. Click on Import tokens and use the following information:

- Token Contract Address: 0xFFfFfFffFFfffFFfFFfFFFFFffFFFffffFfFFFfF
- Token Symbol: DOT
- Decimals: 10

When you are done with adding and importing the DOT asset you can see them in your wallet. You can find the full list of [supported XCM assets here]().
