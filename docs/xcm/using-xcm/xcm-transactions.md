:::caution
It is necessary to verify that the balance of the native asset (ASTR) is not zero for the beneficiary account. Because assets from the Assets pallet cannot be transferred to an account with 0 nonce (or 0 balance)! This applies to all assets except for DOT/KSM assets which on respective networks (Astar for DOT, Shiden for KSM) - Technical term is that DOT/KSM are _sufficient assets_, see User Guide for more details.

When you press the XCM button, the XCM popup appears as follows.

Here we would like to send DOT from Polkadot to Astar Network. There are two tabs, one to send to the Native account and the other to the EVM account. You can check the balance that can be sent from the relay chain (DOT).

Enter the amount to send and press the confirm button. A popup will appear to sign the transaction.

:::caution
Please note that the gas amount will be deducted from the amount entered. The transferred amount should be adjusted with the gas fee estimate.
