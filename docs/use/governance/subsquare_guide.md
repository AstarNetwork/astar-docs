## Intro

:::note
This is _work-in-progress_.
All information here should be correct, but the guide will be updated prior to the launch on Astar.
:::

Astar Network is transitioning its governance system from off-chain voting through Townhall to on-chain voting. This change empowers Astar stakeholders to directly vote on key network proposals and decisions on-chain. Astar governance allows ASTR token holders to influence and participate in decisions that affect the network, such as protocol improvements, runtime updates, and dApp Staking applications.

To interact with the on-chain governance, users have two primary interfaces to choose from: [Subsquare](https://www.subsquare.io/) or the traditional [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) interface. Subsquare provides a user-friendly interface for governance participation, while Polkadot.js offers a more technical approach.

This guide will walk you through the process of participating in Astar on-chain governance using the Subsquare platform. For those who prefer to use Polkadot.js, you can refer to the [Astar Governance Technical Guide](/docs/learn/governance/technical_guide.md).

## What is Astar Governance?

Astar governance is a decentralized mechanism where ASTR token holders can propose, discuss, and vote on important changes and initiatives within the Astar ecosystem. Proposals may cover a wide range of topics, such as protocol upgrades, treasury funding requests, and the management of dApp Staking. This governance system ensures that decisions are made collectively and transparently by the community, reflecting the interests of the networkâ€™s stakeholders.

For a deeper understanding of Astar governance, including its structure and processes, we encourage you to read the [Astar Governance Overview](/docs/learn/governance/index.md) in our documentation.

## Using Subsquare for On-Chain Governance
[Subsquare](https://www.subsquare.io/) is designed to make on-chain governance participation easy for all users. Through Subsquare, you can:

- View active proposals.
- Participate in discussions.
- Cast your votes on governance decisions.
- Track the progress of proposals from submission to execution.

The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate how to utilize the **Subsquare** platform for governance actions on Astar & Shibuya.
Working assumption is that the reader has familiarized themselves with the governance model, and will refer back to the docs if needed.

* Astar Subsquare (_coming soon_)

## Token Holder

### Preimages

Select the `Preimage` tab on the sidebar.

<Figure caption="Preimage - 1" src={require('/docs/use/img/17_Subsquare_preimage/preimage_1.png').default } width="100%" />

The existing preimages are displayed on the page.
They can be reused by anyone to propose a governance action, any number of times.

---

In order to create a new preimage, click on the `New Preimage` button.

<Figure caption="Preimage - 2" src={require('/docs/use/img/17_Subsquare_preimage/preimage_2.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Again, click on the `New preimage` button.
This allows you to create an arbitrary new preimage.

For the sake of this example, we will create a preimage of a `remarkWithEvent` extrinsic call, containing **LGM!** as the _message_.

Note the _hash_ and _length_; these are important for later use.

Submit the message and wait for the transaction to be confirmed and finalized.

<Figure caption="Preimage - 3" src={require('/docs/use/img/17_Subsquare_preimage/preimage_3.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Once the preimage has been created, it will be displayed on the main `Preimage` page.

<Figure caption="Preimage - 4" src={require('/docs/use/img/17_Subsquare_preimage/preimage_4.png').default } width="100%" />

Note that the newly created image has an `Unnote` button. This is because the current user is the creator of the preimage.
Since at this point the preimage is not yet used in any proposal, it can be unnoted, which will remove it from the list of preimages, refunding the deposit.

### Public Proposal

Select the `Public Proposal` tab on the sidebar, under the `Democracy` section.

<Figure caption="Public Proposal - 1" src={require('/docs/use/img/18_Subsquare_public_proposal/public_proposal_1.png').default } width="100%" />

Here the existing public proposals are displayed. Some have been tabled (upgraded to a referendum), some have been proposed, and others might be canceled.

---

Click on the `New Proposal` button to create a new public proposal.
Since a preimage was created in the previous step, it can be used to create a new proposal.

<Figure caption="Public Proposal - 2" src={require('/docs/use/img/18_Subsquare_public_proposal/public_proposal_2.png').default } width="100%" />

---

The hash of the preimage is required to create a new proposal.
In this case, hash of the preimage created earlier is simply copied and pasted into the `Preimage` field.

The `Locked Balance` refers to the amount being _deposited_ (not locked) for the proposal.  
In case the proposal is canceled, the deposit will be slashed.  
In case the proposal is tabled, the deposit will be refunded.  

<Figure caption="Public Proposal - 3" src={require('/docs/use/img/18_Subsquare_public_proposal/public_proposal_8.png').default } width="100%" />

---

After submitting the proposal, some time needs to pass before the transaction is confirmed and finalized.

<Figure caption="Public Proposal - 4" src={require('/docs/use/img/18_Subsquare_public_proposal/public_proposal_3.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Afterwards, it can be observed under the list of public proposals.
The status will be marked as `Proposed`, since it hasn't been _tabled_ (or _canceled_) yet.

<Figure caption="Public Proposal - 5" src={require('/docs/use/img/18_Subsquare_public_proposal/public_proposal_4.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Clicking on the proposal will display more details, and allow to take further actions.

<Figure caption="Public Proposal - 6" src={require('/docs/use/img/18_Subsquare_public_proposal/public_proposal_5.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Proposals can be edited by clicking on the `Edit` button. Title and description can be changed, even a graphic image can be uploaded.
Users can discuss the proposal in the comments section.

<Figure caption="Public Proposal - 7" src={require('/docs/use/img/18_Subsquare_public_proposal/public_proposal_6.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Clicking the `Second` button to support the proposal, increase its chances of being tabled and upgraded to a referendum.
The user has to _match_ the deposit of the proposal, which is displayed on the page.
It is possible to second a proposal multiple times.

<Figure caption="Public Proposal - 8" src={require('/docs/use/img/18_Subsquare_public_proposal/public_proposal_7.png').default } width="100%" />

### Treasury

Clicking on the `Treasury` tab on the sidebar will display the current state of the treasury & spending requests.

<Figure caption="Treasury - 1" src={require('/docs/use/img/19_Subsquare_Treasury/treasury_1.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Clicking on the `New Proposal` button will allow the creation of a new spending proposal.
User needs to pick the payout amount & the beneficiary.
The _Proposal bond_ refers to the amount that needs to be deposited in order to create the proposal.
If the proposal is rejected, the bond will be slashed.
Otherwise, the bond will be refunded.

<Figure caption="Treasury - 2" src={require('/docs/use/img/19_Subsquare_Treasury/treasury_2.png').default } width="100%" />

---

After submitting the proposal, it will be displayed on the treasury page.
The proposal name & description can be edited.

<Figure caption="Treasury - 3" src={require('/docs/use/img/19_Subsquare_Treasury/treasury_3.png').default } width="100%" />

:::note
You can reuse the exact same steps for community treasury proposals.
:::

### Vote Delegation

Click on the `Delegation` tab on the sidebar to access the vote delegation page.
This is an overview of _delegation_ related actions and statistics.

Clicking on the `+ Delegate` button allows you to delegate votes to another account

<Figure caption="Vote Delegation - 1" src={require('/docs/use/img/20_Subsquare_Delegation/delegation_1.png').default } width="100%" />

---

The `Target` is the account to which the votes are being delegated to.
The `Balance` is the amount of native currency we're delegating. This is the amount that will be _locked_.
:::important
The action of delegating voting power **DOES NOT** transfer the ownership of the tokens. They are merely _locked_ for normal use, but remain in the ownership of the delegator.
:::

The `Conviction` setting determines how much your voting power is amplified in exchange for a longer token lock period.

<Figure caption="Vote Delegation - 2" src={require('/docs/use/img/20_Subsquare_Delegation/delegation_2.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Once the delegation has been submitted, it will be displayed on the delegation page.
Clicking on the `Details` label will display more information about the delegation.

<Figure caption="Vote Delegation - 3" src={require('/docs/use/img/20_Subsquare_Delegation/delegation_3.png').default } width="100%" />

---

The amount and conviction are displayed.
Clicking on the `X` button allows to _undelegate_ the votes, which will begin the unlocking period for the tokens.

<Figure caption="Vote Delegation - 4" src={require('/docs/use/img/20_Subsquare_Delegation/delegation_4.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Clicking on the `Account` tab on the sidebar will display the account details.
The 100 SBY locked in previous steps with conviction set to **3** is displayed - equaling a total of 8 days of unlocking period.

<Figure caption="Vote Delegation - 5" src={require('/docs/use/img/20_Subsquare_Delegation/delegation_5.png').default } width="100%" />

### Voting

Clicking on the `Referenda` tab on the sidebar, under the `Democracy` tab, will display all of the referenda, including the ongoing ones, failed ones & executed ones.

For the sake of this example, the referendum named **"Proposal for docs"** will be used.

<Figure caption="Voting - 1" src={require('/docs/use/img/21_Subsquare_voting/voting_1.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Clicking on it will display more details about the referendum as can be seen below.

The user can decide to vote by clicking on the `Vote` button.

<Figure caption="Voting - 2" src={require('/docs/use/img/21_Subsquare_voting/voting_2.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Vote can be `aye` or `nay`, or can even be split between the two options if the user desires.

The token amount to be used for voting needs to be specified - this is the amount that will be _locked_ for the duration of the referendum and more if the referendum passes in the favor of the users vote. E.g. voting `aye` for a referendum, and having it _fail_ will result in the tokens being immediately unlockable, without any waiting period.

Conviction can be set to amplify (or diminish) the voting power, at the expense of a longer (or shorter) unlocking period.

<Figure caption="Voting - 3" src={require('/docs/use/img/21_Subsquare_voting/voting_3.png').default } width="100%" />

---

After the transaction is confirmed and finalized, the vote will be displayed on the referendum page.
Since only one user has voted (us), the total sum of the _aye_ votes is equal to the amount we've voted with.

<Figure caption="Voting - 4" src={require('/docs/use/img/21_Subsquare_voting/voting_4.png').default } width="100%" />

---

In case a user changes their mind, the vote can be removed by clicking on the `Remove Vote` button.
This won't trigger any _unlocking period_ and the user is free to cast their vote again.

<Figure caption="Voting - 5" src={require('/docs/use/img/21_Subsquare_voting/voting_5.png').default } width="100%" />

---

This is an example of an account that is voting but has some votes delegated to it.
In this particular situation, the account has:

* 100 SBY free balance
* 300 SBY worth of voting power delegated to it.

Although not visible on this image, the account who delegated the votes did it with 100 SBY and conviction set to **3**.

The account votes with 50 SBY, conviction set to **4**.
This means that the total amount of votes for this account will be: **50 SBY x 4 + 300 SBY = 500 SBY**.

<Figure caption="Voting - 6" src={require('/docs/use/img/21_Subsquare_voting/voting_6.png').default } width="100%" />

---

The new total turnout is 200 SBY - 50 SBY from the first `aye` vote, another 50 SBY from the second `aye` vote, and 100 SBY from the delegated vote.

The total votes toward `aye` is 600 SBY in total - 100 SBY from the first `aye` vote, and another 500 SBY from the second `aye` vote.

<Figure caption="Voting - 7" src={require('/docs/use/img/21_Subsquare_voting/voting_7.png').default } width="100%" />

## Community Council

### Treasury Spending Approval

Clicking on the `Motions` tab under the `Community Council` sidebar tab will open a view of the `Community Council` motions.

Clicking on the `New Proposal` button will prompt the user to create a new motion.

<Figure caption="Community Treasury Voting - 1" src={require('/docs/use/img/22_Subsquare_comm_treasury/comm_treasury_1.png').default } width="100%" />

---

The focus of this example is community treasury spending approval.

<Figure caption="Community Treasury Voting - 2" src={require('/docs/use/img/22_Subsquare_comm_treasury/comm_treasury_2.png').default } width="100%" />

---

The proposal Id (can be checked under the Community Treasury tab) is required to create a new motion.
Selecting an Id will display the proposal name, which also links to the proposal details.
Community council members should ensure they're proposing and voting on the correct proposal.

<Figure caption="Community Treasury Voting - 3" src={require('/docs/use/img/22_Subsquare_comm_treasury/comm_treasury_3.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Once the proposal creation is submitted, it will be displayed on the `Motions` page.

<Figure caption="Community Treasury Voting - 4" src={require('/docs/use/img/22_Subsquare_comm_treasury/comm_treasury_4.png').default } width="100%" />

---

Clicking on it will display more details, and allow for a vote to be cast.

<Figure caption="Community Treasury Voting - 5" src={require('/docs/use/img/22_Subsquare_comm_treasury/comm_treasury_5.png').default } width="100%" />

---

In this case, one of the council members votes _aye_.

<Figure caption="Community Treasury Voting - 6" src={require('/docs/use/img/22_Subsquare_comm_treasury/comm_treasury_6.png').default } width="100%" />

### dApp Staking With Community Treasury

This is more complex since it requires the user to understand the basics of dApp staking backend.
The proposal call needs to be manually crafted and submitted to the blockchain.

The first thing to select is the threshold.
This can be calculated by taking the expected vote threshold (e.g. 50% or 2/3 of the quorum) and comparing it to the total number of members in the council.
For this particular case, the threshold is set to 2/3 of the council members and we have 3 council members so we set it to 2.

The next is the call builder.
When utilizing the community treasury, the call needs to start with `collectiveProxy -> executeCall`.
After that, the dApp staking call needs to be built. It's possible, and encouraged, to use the _batch_ calls to simplify the voting process.

<Figure caption="dApp Staking - 1" src={require('/docs/use/img/23_Subsquare_dapp_staking/comm_council_ds_1.png').default } width="100%" />

### Registering a New dApp

Unlike the actual staking with the community treasury, registering a new dApp **does not** require the `collectiveProxy`.
Instead, the call should directly propose `dappStaking -> register`.

<Figure caption="dApp Staking - 2" src={require('/docs/use/img/23_Subsquare_dapp_staking/comm_council_ds_2.png').default } width="100%" />
