# Bridge Assets to Astar zkEVM from Astar EVM

This page explains how to transfer `ASTR` between **Astar EVM** and **Astar zkEVM**.  
If you have `ASTR` on Astar native (Substrate) instead, consult [this guide](/docs/use/manage-assets/transfer-tokens#sending-astrsdn-to-astar-evm-from-astar-native-or-any-tokens-in-the-account) to transfer them from Astar native to Astar EVM.

## Transfer using Stargate:

**[Stargate](https://stargate.finance/transfer)** is a community-driven organization building fully composable native asset bridges on LayerZero. [More information](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/v/user-docs).

*Please be advised that Astar Foundation assumes no responsibility or liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting from your utilization of any third-party application presented in our documentation.*

Visit [Stargate application](https://stargate.finance/transfer) and connect your EVM wallet;

### From Astar EVM to Astar zkEVM:

1. Select the token that you want to transfer and select `Astar EVM` for the **source network**;
2. Select the token that you want to receive and select `Astar zkEVM` for the **destination network**;
3. Enter the amount of tokens you want to transfer and confirm the transaction by clicking `Transfer`;  
*The gas cost corresponds to the gas fees for the destination transaction and is paid up-front.*

:::tip
You have the option of requesting gas tokens on Astar zkEVM (`ETH`). Stargate will swap a portion of your assets in ETH and transfer them to your wallet on Astar zkEVM.
