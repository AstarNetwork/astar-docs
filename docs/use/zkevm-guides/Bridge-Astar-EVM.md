# Bridge Assets to Astar zkEVM from Astar EVM

This page explains how to transfer `ASTR` between **Astar EVM** and **Astar zkEVM**.  
If you have `ASTR` on Astar native (Substrate) instead, consult [this guide](/docs/use/manage-assets/transfer-tokens#sending-astrsdn-to-astar-evm-from-astar-native-or-any-tokens-in-the-account) to transfer them from Astar native to Astar EVM.

## Transfer using Stargate:

**[Stargate](https://stargate.finance/transfer)** is a community-driven organization building fully composable native asset bridges on LayerZero. [More information](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/v/user-docs).

*Please be advised that Astar Foundation assumes no responsibility or liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting from your utilization of any third-party application presented in our documentation.*

1. Visit [Stargate](https://stargate.finance/transfer) and connect your EVM wallet;

2. Select the token that you want to transfer and select `Astar EVM` for the **source network**;
3. Select the token that you want to receive and select `Astar zkEVM` for the **destination network**;
4. Enter the amount of tokens you want to transfer and confirm the transaction by clicking `Transfer` ;  
*The gas cost corresponds to the gas fees for the destination transaction and is paid up-front.*

:::tip
You have the option of requesting gas tokens on Astar zkEVM (`ETH`). Stargate will swap a portion of your assets in ETH and transfer them to your wallet on Astar zkEVM.

5. Sign the transaction in your wallet:

6. Once the transaction has been confirmed on the network, you should now see the bridged assets in your EVM wallet, ready for use on Astar zkEVM.

To add tokens to your EVM wallet manually, use the following contract addresses:
- **ASTR:** `0xdf41220C7e322bFEF933D85D01821ad277f90172`
