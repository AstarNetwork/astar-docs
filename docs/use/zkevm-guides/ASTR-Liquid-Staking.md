# ASTR Liquid dApp Staking with Bifrost Finance

This page explains how to participate in Astar dApp Staking via Bifrost Liquid Staking solution on **Astar zkEVM**.
[More information about dApp Staking](/docs/use/dapp-staking/).

If you have `ASTR` on Astar L1 (Subtrate or EVM), consult [this guide](/docs/use/zkevm-guides/Bridge-Astar-EVM/) to transfer them from Astar to Astar zkEVM.

[Bifrost](https://bifrost.app/) is a modular, scalable, non-custodial omnichain liquid staking parachain based on Polkadot. It provides standardized, high-yield, safe, and reliable underlying interest-bearing assets for Web3 through XCM, and is realizing the omnichain vision of using any LST on the any chain. [More information](https://docs.bifrost.finance/).

Bifrost is accessible on Astar zkEVM via its [SLPx Omichain protocol](https://omni.ls/) (OmiLS), a cross-chain mechanism enabling LSD tokens to be minted on Bifrost parachain from EVM chains such as Astar EVM or Astar zkEVM.

The Liquid Staking version of the ASTR token is called **vASTR** (voucher ASTR) is a shadow token of staked ASTR, with fully underlying ASTR reserve and yield-bearing feature of ASTR dApp staking reward. Users can deposit ASTR into Bifrost OmniLS protocol on Astar zkEVM and get vASTR as return, vASTR can be traded in the open market or be redeemed back to ASTR. Holding vASTR equals to holding the ASTR staking position, staking rewards appreciate the exchange price of vASTR.

Bifrost charges a 10% commission on staking rewards.
