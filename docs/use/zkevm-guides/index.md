# Astar zkEVM

## What is Astar zkEVM

Astar zkEVM is Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum offering a blazing fast and more cost-effective experience compared to Ethereum itself. Coupled with support from Polygon, it's the first network to plug into the Aggregation Layer (AggLayer) and harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs to move transaction execution and data availability off-chain, while continuing to operate under the same security umbrella as Ethereum.

For a more detailed explanation of Astar zkEVM, refer to the comprehensive presentation in the [Learn section](/docs/learn/zkEVM/).
