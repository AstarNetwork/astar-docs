title: dApp Staking Code of Conduct
---

This *Code of Conduct* outlines the rules and guidelines that all participants in Astar dApp Staking are expected to follow. Its purpose is to ensure that dApp Staking remains fair, transparent, and efficient for everyone involved.

While these guidelines provide a structured framework, they are not set in stone and may be updated or revised in the future to adapt to the evolving ecosystem.

|  # | Classification | Guidelines |
|----| ------- | ------------|
|  1 | Introduction | Users must fully understand how dApp Staking works before participating. This can be achieved by referring to [official documentation](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/), [blogs](https://astar.network/blog), or community resources. |
|  2 | Definitions and Terminology | dApp Staking is not a funding mechanism or charity program. Projects must be self-sustaining regardless of staking rewards. <br></br><br></br> In this context, self-sufficiency means that while dApp Staking helps launch and support project development, it should not be the primary long-term revenue source. Projects must remain viable even without staking rewards. If additional funding is required, it should be secured from other sources. |
|  3 | Purpose | dApp Staking is designed to support a sustainable ecosystem.<br></br> <br></br> Projects should not promise financial returns to supporters through staking rewards unless they demonstrate tangible contributions to Astar’s growth, backed by onchain metrics and concrete results. <br></br><br></br> The primary purpose of dApp Staking is to expand user adoption and enhance network value. <br></br><br></br> The following on-chain metrics can contribute to asses induced the growth of Astar Network. <br></br> <br></br> Examples for  DeFi projects: <br></br> <ul><li>TVL (Total Value Locked)</li><li>Transaction volume (per time period)</li><li> Generated fees (per time period)</li><li>Number of active wallets</li><li>Revenue generation</li><li>Market capitalization (Mcap)</li></ul> Examples for  NFT projects:<ul><li>Floor price (in USD)</li><li>Total trading volume on marketplaces</li><li>Percentage of collection listed for sale</li><li>Number of unique holders</li></ul>|
|  4 | Compliance Requirements | Projects must not use dApp Staking as a business model. |
|  5 | Definitions and Scope | dApp Staking is not a grant program. To qualify, projects must have an existing and ongoing business. At the time of listing, a project must have a live product or MVP and sufficient documentation for token holders to make informed voting decisions. <br></br><br></br> Unlike traditional grants, dApp Staking is a decentralized incentive mechanism where token holders stake tokens to support projects. The rewards earned are performance-based, depending on community engagement, rather than fixed allocations. Projects must continuously attract support to sustain funding. <br></br><br></br> Meanwhile, the [Unstoppable Community Grants (UCG) program](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/governance/unstoppable-community-grant-program.md) supports early-stage dApps in the Astar ecosystem. It provides up to 17M ASTR over four months, with a possible one-time renewal. The program aligns with dApp Staking V3, using a tier system where, if a dApp in [UCG](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/governance/unstoppable-community-grant-program.md) reaches Tier 2, the grant is terminated. <br></br><br></br> For seed-stage projects (without an MVP or live product) or grant programs, please refer to [UCG](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/governance/unstoppable-community-grant-program.md).|
|  6 | Reporting and Monitoring | All projects participating in dApp Staking are strongly encouraged to report their contributions regularly. <br></br><br></br> Reports should be submitted on the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/) under the `Governance` -> `dApp Staking Reports` subcategory.<br></br><br></br>While monthly reports are preferred, projects can propose an alternative reporting schedule.<br></br><br></br>The content of the reports is left to the discretion of the project and does not need to be detailed; however, it should at least include the following: <ul><li>Project progress</li><li>Roadmap updates</li><li>Key activities and outcomes since the last report</li><li>Quantitative results (as much as possible)</li></ul> For Tier 4 projects, regular reporting is particularly crucial to maintaining community trust. At least monthly reports are expected.<br></br><br></br>The Astar community and Ecosystem Agents will review and provide feedback on reports.<br></br><br></br>If a project fails to report for three consecutive months (or three cycles based on its proposed schedule), the community may issue a warning. If there is no response within three months, the Community Council may initiate a delisting proposal. |
|  7 | Evaluating Negative Impacts | Any community member can initiate a discussion on the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/) to assess whether a project is negatively affecting the Astar ecosystem or failing to provide value. <br></br><br></br> If evidence shows that a project’s behavior is damaging Astar’s reputation or misusing dApp Staking resources, the project will receive a warning. <br></br><br></br> Once warned, the project has 60 days to take corrective action. <br></br><br></br> If the situation does not improve and the project fails to provide a reasonable explanation, the Community Council will initiate a delisting proposal. <br></br><br></br> If delisted, the project may reapply but must clearly demonstrate that all previous issues have been resolved. <br></br><br></br> Examples of Negative Impact and Inappropriate Behavior:<ul><li>Lack of transparency with the community</li><li>Failure to meet the deadlines specified in the guidelines or by the Council/Community</li><li>Insufficient engagement on social media & lack of updates</li><li>Restrictive communication (e.g., only engaging within Discord instead of the Astar Forum)</li><li>Migrating to another ecosystem without benefiting Astar</li><li>Misusing dApp Staking funds for projects outside Astar</li><li>Exploiting the community (e.g., through TGE, liquidity manipulations, or NFT sales)</li></ul> |
|  8 | dApp Categories | Projects must clearly define their primary category (NFT, DeFi, Tooling, Utility, etc.). <br></br><br></br> The current dApp categories include:<ul><li>DeFi (Including LST, Lending, DEX, GameFi, etc.) </li><li>NFT  (Including Digital Art, Collectibles, Music and Concert Tickets, Digital Identity and Certificates, RWA, etc.)</li><li>Tooling (Including Infrastructure, Bridge, Oracle, etc.) </li><li>Utility (Including Wallets, etc.) </li><li>SocialFi </li><li>AI (Including "AI Agent", DeFAI, etc.) </li><li>IoT </li><li>DAO </li><li>DePin </li><li>Stablecoin </li><li>Entertainment (Includinf Game, Metaverse, P2E, etc.) </li></ul> To ensure clarity, projects should avoid using the "Other" category. If a new category is needed, a proposal can be submitted on the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/) for discussion.|
|  9 | Definitions | dApp Staking is not a program of legitimization. <br></br><br></br> While projects undergo a screening process before listing, being included in dApp Staking does not imply automatic trust. Projects must continuously build credibility through consistent contributions, transparency, and community engagement.|
| 10 | Method for dApp Listing Determination | Projects can apply for dApp Staking through the following methods: <br></br><br></br> **Community Council:** <br></br> Projects submit an application via the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/), which is reviewed by the Community Council within two weeks. If the application is approved, the Community Council will whitelist the project to be registered in dApp Staking.<br></br><br></br> **Token Holders:** <br></br> Alternatively, projects can submit a public proposal on [Subsquare](https://astar.subsquare.io/) to be registered in dApp Staking. The proposal will be upgraded to a referendum, where token holders vote on whether to approve the project. If the vote passes, the project is whitelisted and can be registered on-chain. <br></br><br></br> *For more details on application requirements and submission templates, please refer to the [dApp Staking – For Devs section](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/dapp-staking/for-devs/).*|
