title: dApp Staking Code of Conduct
---

This *Code of Conduct* outlines the rules and guidelines that all participants in Astar dApp Staking are expected to follow. Its purpose is to ensure fairness, transparency, and long-term sustainability for projects onboarded across the Astar ecosystem, including those deployed on external but compatible chains such as Soneium, Ethereum, Polkadot, and other parachains.

---

### Overview

dApp Staking is available to projects that provide tangible value and real-world utility to the ASTR token and the broader Astar Ecosysyem. Eligible projects include applications, tools, services, and infrastructure across various blockchain ecosystems.

:::note

Requirements to join dApp Staking may vary depending on the deployment chain. Projects on non-native chains (e.g., Soneium or Ethereum) must clearly demonstrate how they benefit the Astar ecosystem and meaningful ASTR token. This includes—but is not limited to—using ASTR as a payment method, in-app currency, staking mechanism, or any integration that creates real value for ASTR holders.

:::

|  # | Classification | Guidelines |
|----| ------- | ------------|
|  1 | Introduction | Participants must fully understand how dApp Staking works. [Official documentation](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/), [blogs](https://astar.network/blog), and community resources should be consulted before participating. |
|  2 | Definitions and Terminology | dApp Staking is not a grant or charity program. Projects must be capable of sustaining themselves without relying solely on staking rewards. While staking can support early development, it should not be the primary business model. |
|  3 | Purpose | The main objective of dApp Staking is to support the growth of Astar by increasing adoption, engagement, and utility for the ASTR token. Projects should avoid making financial promises unless backed by measurable, on-chain metrics. <br></br><br></br> Examples of measurable value include: <br></br> **DeFi:** TVL, transaction volume, fees generated, active wallets, revenues, market cap. <br></br> **NFTs:** Floor price, marketplace volume, % listed for sale, unique holders. <br></br> 
|  4 | Compliance Requirements | Projects must not treat dApp Staking as a business model. Their sustainability should not rely exclusively on staking rewards. |
|  5 | Definitions and Scope | dApp Staking is not a traditional grant. Projects must be live (or have a working MVP) on a supported chain (e.g., Astar, Soneium) and offer sufficient documentation for token holders to make informed decisions. dApp Staking rewards are community-driven and performance-based. <br></br><br></br> For early-stage, pre-MVP projects, refer to the [Unstoppable Community Grants (UCG) program](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/governance/unstoppable-community-grant-program.md). It offers structured support with clear exit criteria tied to dApp Staking V3’s tier system. <br></br><br></br> External projects must present a clear roadmap demonstrating long-term commitment to Astar. This includes sustained ASTR integration, development milestones, and a strategy for continued ecosystem contribution—even if not natively on Astar Network.|
|  6 | Reporting and Monitoring | Projects are strongly encouraged to submit regular progress reports via the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/) (`Governance` -> `dApp Staking Reports`). At a minimum, reports should cover: <ul><li>Development updates</li> <li>Roadmap progress</li> <li>Key milestones</li> <li>Quantifiable impact metrics</li></ul> <br></br> Tier 4 projects are expected to submit at least monthly updates. A lack of reporting for 3 consecutive months may trigger a delisting process. <br></br><br></br>External projects (e.g., Soneium) must explicitly include how ASTR is used within their platform and report ASTR-related metrics (e.g., usage, transactions, liquidity). Reports can be monthly or quarterly but must be consistent and transparent. |
|  7 | Evaluating Negative Impacts | Any community member can raise concerns if a project is harming the ecosystem on the [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/). If misconduct is confirmed, the project will receive a warning and 60 days to take corrective action. If issues persist, the Community Council may propose delisting. <br></br><br></br> **Examples of harmful behavior:** <ul><li>Lack of transparency</li><li>Failure to meet obligations</li><li>Poor community engagement</li><li>Restricting communication to private channels only</li><li>Misuse of staking rewards</li><li>Abandoning Astar without clear value contribution</li></ul>
|  8 | dApp Categories | Projects must select a primary category for clarity and consistency. <br></br><br></br> The current dApp categories include:<ul><li>DeFi (Including LST, Lending, DEX, GameFi, etc.) </li><li>NFT  (Including Digital Art, Collectibles, Music and Concert Tickets, Digital Identity and Certificates, RWA, etc.)</li><li>Tooling (Including Infrastructure, Bridge, Oracle, etc.) </li><li>Utility (Including Wallets, etc.) </li><li>SocialFi </li><li>AI (Including "AI Agent", DeFAI, etc.) </li><li>IoT </li><li>DAO </li><li>DePin </li><li>Stablecoin </li><li>Entertainment (Includinf Game, Metaverse, P2E, etc.) </li></ul> If your dApp doesn’t fit into these, propose a new category via the  [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/).|
|  9 | Clarification of Endorsement | Inclusion in dApp Staking does not imply endorsement or automatic trust. Projects must earn and maintain credibility through transparent operations, strong community engagement, and consistent results.|
| 10 | Application Process | Projects that meet the requirements can apply via two routes: <br></br><br></br> **1. Community Council Path:** Submit a proposal on th [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/). The Council will review and may whitelist the project within 2 weeks.<br></br><br></br> **2. Token Holder Referendum:** <br></br> Propose directly on [Subsquare](https://astar.subsquare.io/). If passed by public vote, the project is whitelisted and can register on-chain. <br></br><br></br> *For submission templates and technical onboarding details, refer to the [dApp Staking – For Devs section](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/dapp-staking/for-devs/).* <br></br><br></br> All applications from external chains must include a section on ASTR token integration, community alignment, and measurable contribution to Astar Collective’s visibility or growth.|

### Additional Notes for Cross-Ecosystem Projects (e.g., Soneium)

Projects deployed outside Astar Network (on chains like Soneium, Ethereum, or Polkadot) are **welcome** but must meet **stricter eligibility** criteria to reflect their indirect contribution to Astar’s core metrics.

**Minimum expectations include:**
- **Demonstrated integration or utility for the ASTR token** (e.g., as payment, staking collateral, access rights, or governance).
- Visible ASTR usage in-app or in UI, plus marketing mentions on social platforms or documentation.
- Clear contribution to Astar’s brand, visibility, or adoption.
- Concrete roadmap and reporting of ASTR-related KPIs (e.g., usage volume, liquidity, community engagement).
- Efforts to grow the visibility and adoption of ASTR, even if deployed outside Astar Network.
