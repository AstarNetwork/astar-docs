Welcome to the **Move FAQs** section. Here you’ll find answers to the most common questions about how Move works in Astar dApp Staking.

## Q: How many safe moves do I get?
A: 2 in each cycle. In the next cycle, it will refresh to allow 2 moves.

## Q: Does moving always cost a safe move?
**A: Yes**, moving always consumes a safe move when done during **Build & Earn** and to **any registered dApp**.

## Q: What if I split my move across 2 dApps?
A: Each target counts as one move. If you move in total more than your allowance, bonus might be lost on last.

## Q: Why did I lose my bonus?
A: You went over the safe-move limit. If it’s still the same cycle, wait for next cycle and stake fresh to regain it.

## Q: Do I still earn staking rewards in the era I Move my tokens?
A: **No.** Since Move triggers an unstake followed by a stake, your tokens are considered *unstaked* during that era. As a result, **you won’t earn staking rewards for that era**.

## Q: What happens if I move from an unregistered dApp?
A: When moving from an **unregistered dApp**, your **bonus is preserved** and the move **does not count** toward your safe move limit.
