# Move staked tokens

Welcome to the **Move** section.

In this part of the documentation, you'll find all the guidance you need to understand and use **Move**, a feature that allows you to:

* Reallocate your already staked ASTR from one dApp to another without losing your bonus (as long as you're within your safe move limit);
* Optimize your staking strategy based on performance, registration status, or market conditions;
* Learn how staking rewards behave during move actions and how to avoid losing your bonus;
* Combine stakes, handle partial unstakes, and manage bonus logic across dApps.

This feature is part of the Astar dApp Staking experience and is especially powerful during the **Build & Earn** period.

If you need support or have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team or ecosystem agents via the [**official Astar Discord**](https://discord.gg/astarnetwork).
