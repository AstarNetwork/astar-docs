## What is dApp Staking

dApp staking on Astar and Shiden Network introduces a novel approach, empowering individuals to nominate their ASTR or SDN tokens to support dApps building on the network.

For every block produced on the network, a segment of inflation is specifically allocated to dApp staking. These rewards are then divided between the dApp developers and stakers involved, offering benefits to both developers and stakers.

Rewards for stakers and developers are generated during the **Build&Earn** phase of dApp staking; the **Voting** phase does not generate staking rewards (Tokenomics 3.0 has no user-facing bonus rewards).

As a dApp gains popularity and attracts more stakers, the developers stand to receive a greater share of block rewards. Importantly, the dApp staking program is inclusive, accommodating projects utilizing EVM and Wasm technologies.

For a more detailed explanation of dApp Staking, refer to the comprehensive presentation in the [About Astar section](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/index.md).
