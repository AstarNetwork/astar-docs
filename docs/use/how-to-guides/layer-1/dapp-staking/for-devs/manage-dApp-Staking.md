### Your Rewards:

Here you can see how many tokens you have earned for past periods and what you still have to `claim`;

To claim your tokens, click on the **Claim your rewards** button and sign the transaction with your wallet;  
Claiming will release all your pending rewards;

### Edit:

- **Edit Project Page:** Allows you to edit information about your dApp Staking projects;
- **Edit your owner info:** If you want to change the registered smart contract address and the address receiving developer rewards ;
- **Add a promotion card:** If you are running a campaign, you can create a promotion card that will be added to the dApp Staking section of the Portal after review;
