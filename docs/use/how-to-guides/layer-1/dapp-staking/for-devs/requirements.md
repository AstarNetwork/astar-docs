# Requirements to Join dApp Staking

## Astar dApp Staking Program Qualification Criteria

To qualify for the Astar dApp Staking program, your project must meet one or more of the following criteria:

---

### 1. Astar Native/EVM Projects

Your project must be:

- Live and deployed on **Astar Network** — either **Astar Native (WASM)** or **Astar EVM**.
- Functioning with an accessible product.
- Providing clear value to the Astar ecosystem, such as:
  - Integration of the **ASTR token** (utility, payments, staking, etc.)
  - Driving adoption through tools, use cases, community building, or innovative applications.

### 2. Infrastructure or Tooling Providers

Projects offering **essential infrastructure**, tooling, wallets, or middleware — even without a public-facing dApp — are welcome.

**Requirements:**
- Proven track record.
- Active engagement with the Astar ecosystem.

### 3. External Blockchain Projects

*(e.g., Soneium, Ethereum, Polkadot, Other Parachains)*

Projects not deployed directly on Astar but part of its broader ecosystem must:

- Integrate the **ASTR token** in a meaningful way (payment method, in-app utility, or incentive mechanism).
- Offer clear and measurable value to ASTR or Astar Collective.
- Demonstrate efforts to promote visibility, usage, and adoption of ASTR through marketing, documentation, or user incentives.

### 4. Other Projects (Non-dApp / Non-Smart Contract Based)

Projects that don’t use smart contracts or don’t fall into the above categories may still qualify if:

- They bring **measurable value** to Astar and the ASTR token.
- Actively engage with the Astar community (Forum, Discord, Telegram, X).
- Introduce the project on the **[Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/)** and participate in discussions.

> **Note**: Community feedback plays a key role in evaluating eligibility.

### Additional Expectations for External Projects

Projects deployed outside the Astar Network must demonstrate:

- A clear commitment to the ecosystem with regular updates (monthly/quarterly) on platform progress, ASTR utility, and contributions.
- A **published roadmap** aligning with Astar’s long-term mission.
- Measurable **impact metrics or milestones**.
- Participation in ecosystem growth (content, marketing, onboarding, liquidity programs, cross-chain collaboration).

#### Examples of Meaningful ASTR Contributions

- Displaying **ASTR** on your dApp interface or documentation.
- Using ASTR as a **payment method**, gas token, or in-app currency.
- Incentive mechanisms using ASTR (discounts, staking bonuses, exclusive access).
- Marketing/communications that promote ASTR or Astar Collective.
- Liquidity pools or TVL involving ASTR (on Astar or bridged networks).
- Direct/bridged integration with Astar or connected parachains (e.g., Polkadot, Soneium).
- Community campaigns or content spotlighting ASTR or Astar Collective.
