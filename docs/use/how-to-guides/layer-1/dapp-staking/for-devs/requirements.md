Astar is aiming to become a DAO in a couple of years. While moving towards becoming a DAO our dApp staking onboarding also includes passing our council. The dApp staking application process is as stated below: 
:::

### Astar Network

- Your dApp is **launched and live on Astar Network**
- Does your project contribute to Astar TVL? Make sure you are listed on [DefilLama] (/docs/build/integrations/dapp-listing/defillama.md).
- List your project on [DappRadar](/docs/build/integrations/dapp-listing/dappradar.md).
- Your dApp has #astar-network, #dAppStaking tags in your GitHub repo.
- You need to create a PR to the Ecosystem Page. As our website is open-source, you can contribute directly to it - just create a PR on your own! [Here](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/astarwebsite_v2/blob/349db39d724b57f58fbee84b3fa500bf0d29bee6/components/Header.vue)
- If you wish to have your project listed on Astar website [ecosystem page](https://astar.network/community/ecosystem), fill in this [FORM](https://forms.gle/xsGUnCt3fm4isWWF7).
- Create your proposal to join dApp staking on our [forum](https://forum.astar.network/c/initiatives/dapp-staking-applications/21). For creating your proposal, you can take inspiration from the following [template](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/dapp-staking/for-devs/requirements.md#template-for-dapp-staking-application). 
- After the proposal is created, we will get the community to discuss. You are expected to answer all the questions. This will take around 4-5 days.
- The voting will be opened after the discussion period.
- For now, only the forum members with `Trust Level 2` and above are allowed to vote.
- After the voting is passed, you are should follow the registration instructions in the [Register dApp](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/dapp-staking/for-devs/register-dapp) page. 

#### What about infrastructure partners?

You don’t have any dApp but you are providing infrastructure services to the Astar ecosystem. You also can be added to dApp staking.

- You already have a long-term partnership with Astar and a close relationship with some projects.
- You have a proven record in our ecosystem.
- You have docs about how to use your tools in our documentation and in yours. You can add instructions to our documentation by creating a PR on our Github.
- Create a proposal to join dApp staking on our [forum](https://forum.astar.network/c/initiatives/dapp-staking-applications/21). For creating your proposal, you can take inspiration from the following [template](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/dapp-staking/for-devs/requirements.md#template-for-dapp-staking-application).

#### What about other projects who can't meet the above requirements?

You can't add your project to DefilLama because it's not generating any TVL, also DappRadar is not an option because there is no use of smart contracts? These are the current steps to follow:

- Be active in our community Discord channel and post your project updates in our dedicated `#project discussion` channel.
- Create a proposal to join dApp staking on our [forum](https://forum.astar.network/c/initiatives/dapp-staking-applications/21). For creating your proposal, you can take inspiration from the following [template](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/dapp-staking/for-devs/requirements.md#template-for-dapp-staking-application).
- After the proposal is created, we will get the community to discuss. You are expected to answer all the questions. This will take around 4-5 days.
- The voting will be opened after the discussion period.
- For now, only the forum members with Trust Level 2 and above are allowed to vote.
- After the voting is passed, you are should follow the registration instructions in the [Register dApp](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/dapp-staking/for-devs/register-dapp.md) page. 

### Shiden Network

- Your dApp is **launched and live on Shiden Network**.
- Does your project contribute to the growth of Shiden it would be great to list your project on DappRadar and or DefilLama. This is not a requirement but it would help grow the trust for your project with our community.
- Infrastructure partners who are contributing to our ecosystem and need to cover their costs can apply to our dApp staking mechanism on Shiden.
