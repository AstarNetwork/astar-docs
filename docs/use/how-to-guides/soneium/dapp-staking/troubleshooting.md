This guide addresses common issues encountered when staking **ASTR** tokens on **Soneium** using platforms like **Neemo Finance** and **Astake**.

## 1. Why don't I see my nsASTR or wstASTR tokens after staking?

**Issue:** After staking ASTR, the corresponding liquid staking tokens (nsASTR or wstASTR) are not visible in your wallet.

**Solution:**

- **Add Token Manually:** Ensure you've added the token to your wallet using the correct contract address.
  - For **nsASTR**, refer to Neemo Finance's documentation.
  - For **wstASTR**, refer to Astake's documentation.
- **Network Selection:** Confirm that your wallet is connected to the **Soneium** network.
- **Wallet Compatibility:** Use wallets that support custom tokens and networks, such as MetaMask or Zerion.

## 2. My staking transaction is pending or failed. What should I do?

**Issue:** Staking transactions remain pending or have failed.

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

- **Insufficient Gas Fees:** Ensure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees.
- **Network Congestion:** High network traffic can delay transactions. Wait and try again later.
- **Token Approval Missing:** Before staking, you must approve the token for transfer. Check if you've granted the necessary permissions.

## 3. I can't unstake my tokens. Why?

**Issue:** Unable to unstake nsASTR or wstASTR tokens.

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

- **Lock-up Period:** Some staking platforms have a lock-up period. Check the specific terms on Neemo Finance or Astake.
- **Unstaking Process:** Ensure you're following the correct unstaking procedure as outlined in the platform's documentation.
- **Platform-Specific Issues:** Refer to the platform's support channels for assistance.

## 4. How do I verify the status of my staking transaction?

**Solution:**

- **Soneium Block Explorer:** Use the [Soneium Block Explorer](https://soneium.blockscout.com/) to check transaction statuses.
- **Wallet Transaction History:** Most wallets provide a transaction history where you can see pending, successful, or failed transactions.
- **Platform Interface:** If you used a staking platform, their interface might offer transaction tracking features.

## 5. My wallet doesn't support custom networks. What should I do?

**Issue:** Your current wallet doesn't allow adding custom networks, preventing interaction with Soneium.

**Solution:**

- **Import Wallet into a Compatible One:** Transfer your wallet credentials (seed phrase or private key) into a wallet that supports custom networks, such as MetaMask or Zerion.

## 6. I sent tokens to the wrong address. Can I recover them?

**Issue:** Tokens were sent to an incorrect or unintended address.

**Explanation:**

- **Irreversible Transactions:** Blockchain transactions are immutable. Once confirmed, they cannot be reversed.
- **Contact Recipient:** If you know the owner of the address, you can request them to return the tokens.
- **Preventive Measures:** Always double-check addresses before confirming transactions to avoid such issues.
