## 1. Overview

In this guide, you’ll learn how to participate in **Astar dApp Staking** on **Soneium** using [**Neemo Finance**](https://neemo.finance/) or [**Astake**](https://www.astake.dev/). This practical guide will explain how you can take part in this mechanism using your **ASTR**.

To complete this tutorial, you’ll need:

- A wallet that supports the **EVM** format (we’ll use [**Zerion**](https://zerion.io/))
- The **Soneium network** added to your wallet so you can view your funds
- **ASTR** tokens on the Soneium network in your wallet

:::info Wallet Setup

To configure your wallet with the Soneium network, follow [**this guide**](https://docs.soneium.org/docs/users/wallets) from the official docs.

:::
:::tip Get ASTR tokens

If you want to acquire ASTR tokens on the Soneium using your local currency, use [**Alchemy Pay**](https://ramp.alchemypay.org/#/index).

Also, learn how to transfer tokens to Soneium from Astar [**here**](/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/from-astar-to-soneium.md). If you hold assets on other chains, learn how to transfer them to Soneium [**here**](/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/from-ethereum-to-soneium.md).

:::

This guide assumes you already:

- Have your wallet set up with the **Soneium network**.
- Have **ASTR** tokens available in your wallet.
- Have some **ETH** to cover  gas fees.

We’ll now walk through the full transfer process step by step.
