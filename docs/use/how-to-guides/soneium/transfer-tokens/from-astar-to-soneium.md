## 1. Overview

In this guide, you’ll learn how to transfer **ASTR** tokens from **Astar Network** to **Soneium (L2)** using the bridge on the **Astar Portal** and the [**Subwallet**](https://www.subwallet.app/) and [**Zerion**](https://zerion.io/) wallets. To complete this tutorial, you’ll need:

- A wallet that supports the **Substrate** format (we’ll use Subwallet)
- A wallet that supports the **EVM** format (we’ll use Zerion)
- ASTR tokens in your Substrate wallet on Astar L1

:::info Wallet Setup

To set up your wallet on Astar Network, follow → [**this guide**](/docs/use/get-started/index.md), and use → [**this one**](https://docs.soneium.org/docs/users/wallets) for Soneium.

:::
:::tip Get ASTR tokens

To acquire ASTR tokens through a DEX or CEX, follow [**this guides**](/docs/use/how-to-guides/layer-1/get-astr-token/index.md) in our documentation.

:::

This guide assumes you already:

- Have both **wallets** set up.
- Hold ASTR tokens in your **Substrate wallet** on Astar.
- You have a bit of extra ASTR tokens for the fees.

We’ll now walk through the full transfer process step by step.

## 2. Guide to Transfer ASTR from Astar to Soneium

### Step 1: Access the Astar Portal

Go to our [**Astar Portal**](https://portal.astar.network/astar/assets), the site where you can manage your funds and accounts within **Astar Network**.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-1.png').default} width="100%" />

Select the network, in this case, **Astar (L1)**.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-2.png').default} width="100%" />

### Step 2: Connect to Substrate

Click on **Select wallet**.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-3.png').default} width="100%" />

Choose the wallet you use, in this case, it will be **Subwallet**, so we’ll click on **Subwallet logo** to open the modal and connect it.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-4.png').default} width="100%" />

### Step 3: Go to Send section

Once you’re connected, you’ll see a panel showing your balances and connected account. Now we need to send your funds to the **Astar EVM** version.

Click the **Send** button.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-5.png').default} width="100%" />

### Step 4: Send ASTR to EVM

Once you’re in this section, there are three important things to keep in mind:

1. Enter an **EVM address** in the **"to"** field, this is where you’ll send the tokens.
2. Enter the amount you want to send.
3. Make sure you’re not sending EVM funds to exchange accounts.

Once everything is ready, click the **Confirm** button to submit the transaction.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-6.png').default} width="100%" />

If everything is correct, you’ll see a message confirming that the transaction was successfully executed, and you’ll be able to view your transaction in the **block explorer**.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-7.png').default} width="100%" />

### Step 5: Connect EVM

Now that we’ve sent the funds to an EVM wallet, we need to connect it to the portal to view the balance, so let’s go ahead and do that.

Go to the **wallet** button and click it.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-8.png').default} width="100%" />

Choose the wallet you use, in this case, it will be **Zerion**, so we’ll click on **Metamask** to open the modal and connect it.

:::info Metamask Mode

Zerion uses a mode called Metamask mode, where every request made to Metamask is handled by Zerion first. That’s why we click on Metamask, as the Zerion logo doesn’t appear directly.

### Step 6: Go to Bridge to Soneium

When you’re connected to your EVM wallet, you’ll be able to see your funds and an interface with additional options. Now, we have to bridge to Soneium.

Go to the **Bridge to Soneium** section by clicking the button.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-10.png').default} width="100%" />

### Step 7: Send ASTR to Soneium

Once you’re on the bridge page, you’ll see that the transaction is set to go from **Astar EVM** to **Soneium**. Enter the amount you want to send, approve the transaction by clicking the **Approve** button, and finally, initiate the bridge.

:::info Fee costs

Pay close attention to the bridge fee and the time the transaction usually takes.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-11.png').default} width="100%" />

If everything is correct, you’ll see a message confirming that the transaction was successfully executed, and you’ll be able to view your transaction in the [**block explorer**](https://astar.blockscout.com/).

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/use/how-to-guides/soneium/transfer-tokens/images/astar-to-soneium/astar-to-soneium-12.png').default} width="100%" />

### Step 8: Verify the transaction

Finally, you can go to the [**Soneium block explorer**](https://soneium.blockscout.com/) or check the transaction details in your wallet, either way, you’ll be able to verify that your ASTR tokens have arrived on the Soneium network within minutes.

Congratulations! You’ve successfully sent tokens from Astar Substrate (L1) to Soneium quickly and easily.
