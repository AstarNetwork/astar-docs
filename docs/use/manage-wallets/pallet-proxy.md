# Create a Proxy Account
---
This tutorial will be using [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.shiden.astar.network#/extrinsics) for manipulating proxies.

To create a proxy account, follow these steps:

1. **Go to the Developer tab:** Locate and navigate to the "Developer" tab on the website.

2. **Select Extrinsics:** Within the Developer tab, find the "Extrinsics" and select it.

3. **Select the primary account:** Choose the primary account for which you want to create a proxy from the list. We will be using **ALICE** as primary account in this tutorial.

4. **Submit the following extrinsic:** From the `submit the following extrinsic` dropdown, select **proxy**

5. Choose the **addProxy** extrinsic

6. Select the **delegate** account for the proxy

7. **Choose the proxyType:** From the proxyType dropdown, choose **Balances**

8. **(Optional) Add a time delay:** If desired, you may have the option to add a time delay to the transaction. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring the primary account to review the pending transaction before it is executed. Specify the desired number of blocks for the time delay.

9. **Submit the transaction:** Once you have filled in all the necessary details, find the button to submit the transaction. Click on it to initiate the process.

You will then be prompted to authorize and sign the transaction. Go ahead and click **Sign and Submit** to create the proxy relationship.

Once the transaction has been successfully submitted, you will receive notifications confirming the transaction.

You can also find the event `proxy.ProxyAdded` in recently emitted events inside  **Network** > **Explorer** tab.

**Verifying Proxy Account**

3. Select **Manage proxies** option.


Here you can see the list of all proxies that you account has. For this tutorial, it is only **Balances** proxy that we added in the above section.

You can also remove the proxy by clicking on the (X) icon next to the proxy account (in our case **BOB**). After clicking (X) button, the proxy will diappear from the list, Click on `Submit`.

Once the transaction has successfully been submitted, you can review your current proxies or if you removed all proxies you will notice the proxy icon is no longer being displayed next to the primary account.
