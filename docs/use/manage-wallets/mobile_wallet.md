# Create an Astar Wallet on a Mobile Device

**This guide will support you to setup an Astar/Shiden wallet for both EVM and Native on your mobile.**
---

There are a few mobile wallets that support Astar native environment such as [Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/), [Math Wallet](https://mathwallet.org/en-us/) and [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app/), while [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) supports Astar EVM. In this tutorial, we will use Math Wallet since it supports both Native and EVM.

1. Download [Math Wallet](https://mathwallet.org/en-us/) for either Android or iOS.
2. Select Astar for Native and Astar EVM for EVM.

3. Select "Create Wallet" if you want to create a new wallet (You can also import wallet if you want to restore an existing wallet from other devices).
4. Give the wallet a name and password and please remember to store your password in a safe and secure place.
5. Write down the 12-word seed phrase and store it in a safe and secure place.

8. Your Astar wallet is now ready.
9. Click on the dApp browser and you will be able to use [Astar portal](https://portal.astar.network/) to use dApp staking (only on Astar Native) and make [token transfers](https://docs.astar.network/docs/user-guides/transfer-tokens) between native to EVM and vice versa.

That's all and as a **REMINDER**, please make sure you save the seed phrase and password in a safe and secure place. Don't share this with anyone!
