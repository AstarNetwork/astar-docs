## What is MetaMask?

MetaMask is a web browser extension and mobile app that allows you to manage your Ethereum private keys. By doing so, it serves as a wallet for Ether and other tokens such as ASTR on Astar Network EVM, and allows you to interact with decentralized applications, or dapps. Unlike some wallets, MetaMask keeps no information on you: not your email address, not your password, and not your Secret Recovery Phrase or other private keys. You retain all power over your crypto-identity.

After adding MetaMask Extension, MetaMask will automatically open. You can also make sure it's easily accessible in your toolbar by clicking the jigsaw icon in the top-right of the screen, and hitting the pin icon.

### Configuring your privacy settings

When installing the MetaMask extension, you'll be able to adjust privacy settings one-by-one to ensure the app is set up according to your privacy preferences.

To do this, simply hit the 'Advanced configuration' button in the wallet set-up process. Here you can toggle/configure settings including:

- Phishing detection
- Incoming transactions
- Additional token price information from third-party sources
- The [default RPC provider](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/how-does-metamask-connect-to-a-blockchain-network/)
- Token autodetect
- Batch account requests
- Custom IPFS gateway.

Don't worry if you're unsure during setup: once your wallet is up and running, you can access the same settings at any time in Settings > Security & Privacy.

## Setting Up Your Wallet
