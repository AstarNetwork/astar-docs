# Portal Troubleshooting Guide

This section will guide you to troubleshoot and solve most issues when connecting to the portal.

## Can't Connect Wallet To The Portal

**Allow Polkadot.js to access the portal**
1. Go to Polkadot.js browser extension.
2. Click on the `Gear` icon.
3. Click on `Manage Website Access`.
4. Make sure `https://portal.astar.network` is allowed.

**Allow Polkadot.js to be used on Astar/Shiden**
1. Go to Polkadot.js browser extension.
2. Click on the `3 dots`.
3. On the dropdown menu, select `Allow use on any chain`.
4. If you have other extensions installed, please revoke access of those extensions.

## Getting Errors Or Unable To Execute Certain Functions
Some of you may be unable to execute certain funtions. Please try these steps.
1. Update metadata (if required).
2. Clear cache, restart browser and connect wallet to the portal again.
3. On the top right corner, switch to a different endpoint.
4. Brave browser is known to give errors. Use Chrome or Firefox instead.
5. Use VPN.

## Unable To Claim Staking Rewards
1. If you can't claim the staking rewards on the portal. Visit [HERE](https://docs.astar.network/docs/use/user-guides/manual_claim).
2. If the transferrable balance in the wallet is too low, you might not be able to claim the staking rewards. Top up your wallet or turn off `auto-restake` and then claim the rewards. Turning off `auto-restake` reduces the amount of transactions therefore reducing the amount of gas needed.
