# How to stake

:::warning

 To earn rewards continuously, users have to vote and stake **every [new period](/docs/use/dapp-staking/for-stakers/#periods-subperiods--eras).**

 :::

At the end of a Period, tokens are unstaked from all dApps, remain locked on the account but must be staked back on dApps for the new Period.

### Visit dApp Staking on the Portal

Go to the [Astar Portal](https://portal.astar.network/astar/dapp-staking/discover):  and click on the `dApp Staking` page.

Make sure you are connected to the correct network.
- **Shibuya Network**: testnet
- **Shiden Network**: mainnet on Kusama
- **Astar Network**: mainnet on Polkadot
