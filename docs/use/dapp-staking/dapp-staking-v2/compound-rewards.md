# Compound Rewards

There are two different way of compounding your rewards.

- Re-Stake the rewards automatically after stakers make a claim.
- Auto-compounding (partnered with Turing Network) (We are currently working on this feature!).

## Re-Stake the rewards after claiming

Re-Stake rewards feature allows stakers to claim staked rewards which will be automatically restaked on the same dApp. So rather than having to make two extrinsic calls and having to sign two transactions, users need to only make one extrinsic call to claim the rewards and those rewards are automatically reinvested.

The Re-Stake rewards feature is enabled by default. You can disable this feature via the portal.
