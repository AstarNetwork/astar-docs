# dApp Staking

dApp staking on Astar and Shiden Network introduces a novel approach, empowering individuals to nominate their ASTR/SDN tokens to support specific dApps.

For every block produced on the network, a segment of inflation is specifically allocated to dApp staking. These rewards are then divided between the dApp developers and stakers involved, offering benefits to both developers and stakers.

As a dApp gains popularity and attracts more stakers, the developers stand to receive a greater share of block rewards. 

Importantly, the dApp staking program is inclusive, accommodating projects utilizing EVM and Wasm technologies, along with zkEVM dApps.
