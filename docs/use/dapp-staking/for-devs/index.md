# For Developers

## Overview

Discover [dApp Staking](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/), a unique mechanism that allows communities to support their favorite teams by staking ASTR or SDN with them. When staking ASTR or SDN on a dApp, users not only support the development of innovative apps but also receive staking rewards from inflation.

You can educate yourself more by reading the technical documentation about [dApp Staking](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/).

**Are you a product owner and want to list your dApp in our staking mechanism to earn rewards?**  

Please take the following parameters into consideration and make sure you meet the [requirements](/docs/use/dapp-staking/for-devs/requirements.md):

:::tip

Before reading the dApp Staking section for dApp owner, make sure you understand the concept of periods, subperiods and eras, as well as the dApp Staking V3 parameters explained [here](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/#period--subperiods).

### Tier System and Rewards

dApp Staking introduces the concept of a tier system for dApps. It's important to fully understand the [tier mechanism](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/dapp-staking-protocol#tier-system) before proceeding with dApp Staking application and registration as a dApp owner.

Currently, there are **4 tiers** with a limited number of slots per tier. Tier capacity for dApp staking is calculated at the start of each period based on the ASTR price as described [here](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/dapp-staking-protocol#tier-system).  

The slots allocated to each tier can be viewed on the [dApp Staking Page](https://portal.astar.network/astar/dapp-staking/discover) of the Astar Portal.

At the end of each **Build&Earn** subperiod, dApps are assigned to a tier based on the total value staked on them by users. Each tier has a **threshold** that a dApp must reach in order to access it.

The threshold for tier 4 is fixed, but for the other tiers, the threshold is **dynamic** and calculated at the start of each new period based on the total number of slots for the period. To find out more, [click here](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/dapp-staking-protocol#tier-threshold-entry).

**Rewards** for dApps are also **dynamic**, fluctuating from tier to tier. The higher the tier, the greater the number of ASTR tokens allocated from inflation as rewards for that tier.

The rewards of a tier are divided between all available slots and distributed to the dApps occupying slots. This means that the rewards for dApps within a tier are the same for each dApp, even if not all slots within a tier are occupied.

*Refer to the [dApp staking parameters](/docs/learn/dapp-staking/protocol-parameters#network-values) page to find out more about the tier system and reward allocation.*

:::tip
You have to claim your rewards to receive them. We recommend that you claim your rewards at least once a week or, optimistically, 2 or 3 times a week.

**Example:**

- Tier 1 has 5 slots for dApps and 50,000 ASTR tokens are allocated as a reward;
- At the end of the voting subperiod, only 3 slots are occupied by dApps in Tier 1 ;
- These 3 dApps will each receive 10,000 ASTR as reward;
- The remaining 20,000 ASTR tokens will not be minted by the network and will be considered burnt;

:::

If there are more dApps eligible for a tier than there is capacity, the dApps with the higher score get the advantage. dApps which missed out on a higher tier get priority for entry into the next lower tier (if there still is any).

In the case a dApp doesn't satisfy the entry threshold for any tier, even though there is still capacity, the dApp will simply be left out of tiers and won't earn any reward.

:::warning

In the event that a dApp is **unregistered** from dApp Staking following a governance decision, all developer unclaimed rewards will become unavailable. We recommend that dApp owners claim their rewards regularly.
