# How to set up a Zombienet with a relaychain and parachains for XCM testing

## TL;DR

Zombienet is a testing framework for Substrate-based blockchains, providing a simple CLI tool that allows users to spawn any Substrate-based blockchains including Astar, Shiden, and Polkadot relaychain. The assertions used in the tests can include on-chain storage, metrics, logs, and custom javascript scripts that interact with the chain.

To test XCM-related features, there are mainly two options: Rococo and local Zombienet. But some parachains may not deploy testnets to Rococo. And some XCM-related testings (XC-20 asset registration, HRMP channel opening, etc.) may require `sudo` access to the testnet which is in the testnet operator’s hands. Thus, the ideal choice for XCM testings is local Zombienet for now.

In this cookbook, we will guide you on how to set up Zombienet, how to spawn and configure the testnet with the latest release of Polkadot relaychain, Shiden, and Shibuya, and how to test XCM-related features with local Zombienet.

## What is Zombienet?

Zombienet is a testing framework for Substrate-based blockchains, providing a simple CLI tool that allows users to spawn any Substrate-based blockchains including Astar, Shiden, and Polkadot relaychain. The assertions used in the tests can include on-chain storage, metrics, logs, and custom javascript scripts that interact with the chain.

In this cookbook, we are setting up a local testnet environment with Polkadot relaychains with Shiden and Shibuya parachains connected.

## What is XCM?

**Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM)** aims to be a language to communicate ideas between consensus systems. One of Polkadot's promises is interoperability, and XCM is the vehicle through which it will deliver this promise. Simply, it is a standard that allows protocol developers to define the data and origins that their chains can send and receive from, including cross-chain asset transfer between parachains.

## Set up Zombienet CLI

In this section, we will set up Zombienet CLI using binary. You can also set up Zombienet with docker, kubernetes, and more using the guide [here](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet#requirements-by-provider).

- Let’s create a folder in the root directory to hold the binaries
    
    ```jsx
    mkdir cookbook-zombienet
    cd cookbook-zombienet
    ```
    
- Go to [https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases) and download the binary built for your local environment.
    - Please don’t forget to replace the release version number in the command line to the latest release.
    - In this cookbook, we are using [https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/v1.3.22/zombienet-macos](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/v1.3.22/zombienet-macos)
- Move the binary to our cookbook folder.
    
    ```jsx
    mv ~/downloads/zombienet-macos ~/cookbook-zombienet
    ```
    
- Add execution permission to the Zombienet CLI binary file.
    - If you are using a Mac, you may need an extra step to configure the security settings:
        - Go to Apple menu > System Settings > Privacy & Security
        - Under security, add the `astar` binary file that you just downloaded to the whitelist
        - Then, continue with the following command
    
    ```jsx
    chmod +x zombienet-macos
    ```
    
- Confirm if the binary is executable in your local environment.
    
    ```jsx
    ./zombienet-macos --help
    ```
    
- If Zembienet CLI is installed correctly, you should see the following info:
    
    ```jsx
    Usage: zombienet [options] [command]
    
    Options:
      -c, --spawn-concurrency <concurrency>  Number of concurrent spawning process to launch, default is 1
      -p, --provider <provider>              Override provider to use (choices: "podman", "kubernetes", "native")
      -m, --monitor                          Start as monitor, do not auto cleanup network
      -d, --dir <path>                       Directory path for placing the network files instead of random temp one (e.g. -d /home/user/my-zombienet)
      -f, --force                            Force override all prompt commands
      -h, --help                             display help for comma
    ```

## Build the `polkadot` binary file

In order to spawn a testnet with a relychain and two parachains, we need the corresponding binary files for Polkadot relaychain and Astar Network. In this section, we will build the `polkadot` binary file.

- First, let’s clone the `polkadot` source code
    
    ```jsx
    git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot
    ```
    
- Make sure you have the latest Rust and the support tools installed so that you can compile the `polkadot` source code smoothly.
    
    ```jsx
    rustup update
    brew install protobuf
    ```
    
- Checkout the latest release (v0.9.34 for now), compile the `polkadot` source code, and build the `polkadot` binary file.
    
    ```jsx
    cd polkadot
    git checkout release-v0.9.34
    cargo build --release
    ```
    
- After the compilation, you will have a `polkadot` binary file. Rename the old Polkadot folder and move the `polkadot` binary to our cookbook folder.
    
    ```jsx
    mv ~/cookbook-zombienet/polkadot ~/cookbook-zombienet/polkadot-built
    mv ~/cookbook-zombienet/polkadot-built/target/release/polkadot ~/cookbook-zombienet
    ```

## Download `astar-collator` binary file

- Download the latest release of [astar-collator](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/releases) for macOS for Ubuntu from https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/releases
    
    <aside>
    💡 Please make sure you are running a macOS or Ubuntu with the appropriate version. For macOS, please use the versions above MacOS 12.0.
    
    </aside>
    
- Move the binary file to our cookbook folder.
    
    ```jsx
    mv ~/downloads/astar-collator ~/cookbook-zombienet
    ```
    
- Add execution permission to the binary file
    - If you are using a Mac, you may need an extra step to configure the security settings:
        - Go to Apple menu > System Settings > Privacy & Security
        - Under security, add the `astar-collator` binary file that you just downloaded to the whitelist
        - Then, continue with the following command
    
    ```jsx
    chmod +x ./astar-collator
    ```

## Download the configuration file for Zombienet

In order to spawn the Zombienet, we need to add a configuration file to specify the configurations. We have a configuration file ready here configured to two parachains named `shiden-dev` and `shibuya-dev`, and a relaychain named `rococo-local` : [https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/tree/master/third-party/zombienet](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/tree/master/third-party/zombienet)

- Download the configuration file from [https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/blob/master/third-party/zombienet/multi_parachains.toml](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/blob/master/third-party/zombienet/multi_parachains.toml)
    
    ```jsx
    curl -o multi_parachains.toml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AstarNetwork/Astar/master/third-party/zombienet/multi_parachains.toml
    ```
    

---

## Start the Zombienet with the configuration file

- Start the Zombienet with the configuration file
    
    ```jsx
    ./zombienet-macos -p native spawn multi_parachains.toml
    ```
    
- After starting the Zombienet successfully, you will be able to see the local testnet endpoint and explorer link as shown below.

## Set up cross-chain assets on two parachains

The HRMP channels between `shiden-dev` and `shibuya-dev` are opened as configured in the `multi_parachains.toml` configuration file.

To proceed to the next step of XCM testing, we only need to register the native assets of `shiden-dev` and `shibuya-dev` on each other to pay for XCM execution on the remote chain.

- Go to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:51931#/explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:51931#/explorer) (or the link specified in `Direct Link` of `collator1` )
    - Click `Developer → Extrinsics → Decode` and input the following call data, to register `xcSDN` on `shibuya-dev`.
        - Please make sure to submit the extrinsics via `Alice`'s account which have enough `SBY` balance.
    
    ```jsx
    0x63000b02102401910100d43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d0102093d002410910114786353444e14786353444e12003600010101005d1f91013601010101005d1f02286bee
    ```
    
- Go to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:51934#/explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:51934#/explorer) (or the link specified in `Direct Link` of `collator2` )
    - Click `Developer → Extrinsics → Decode` and input the following call data, to register `xcSBY` on `shiden-dev`.
        - Please make sure to submit the extrinsics via `Alice`'s account which have enough `SDN` balance.
    
    ```jsx
    0x63000b02102401210300d43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d0102093d00241021031478635342591478635342591200360001010100411f2103360101010100411f02286bee
    ```

## Execute a simple remote call from Shiden to Shibuya

In this section, we will create an XCM remote call that will send an instruction from `shiden-dev` to execute `System::remark_with_event` on `shibuya-dev`.

For more details on how to create a remote execution call and how the derived account works, we will explain in the next cookbook.

- Send some `SBY` to Alice’s derived account on **Shibuya** - `5Cvcv8RvSsp6go2pQ8FRXcGLAzNp5eyC8Je7KLHz5zFwuUyT` to pay for the gas fee of executing `System::remark_with_event`.
    - The remote call won’t be executed via Alice's account on Shibuya directly, but with a new derived account. Thus, we need to send `SBY` to the derived account.
    
    ![Untitled](img-zombienet-cookbook/Untitled%201.png)
    
- Initiate the remote call by inputting the following call data in **Shiden’s** `Developer → Extrinsics → Decode`.
    
    ```jsx
    0x330001010100411f021400040000000013000064a7b3b6e00d130000000013000064a7b3b6e00d00060102286bee140a0808abba140d010004000101002611a3b92e2351f8b6c98b7b0654dc1daab45b2619ea357a848d4fe2b5ae1863
    ```
    
- After 2 blocks, you will be able to observe the executed `System::remark_with_event` in **Shibuya’s** explore under the recent blocks.
