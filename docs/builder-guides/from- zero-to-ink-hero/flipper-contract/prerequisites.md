- Basic Rust knowledge. [Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)

# What will we do ?

in this tutorial we will implement the most basic contract [Flipper](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/v3.3.0/examples/flipper/lib.rs) in ink!:

# What will we use ?

[ink! 3.3.0](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/v3.3.0)

# What will you learn ?

- Define contract storage
- Callable functions
- Unit test your contract
