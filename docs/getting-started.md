# Getting Started

Astar is the largest smart contract platform in the Polkadot ecosystem, supporting both Wasm and EVM. While providing native access to the Polkadot ecosystem through it's parachain slot, Astar also has bridges into other major ecosystems, including [Ethereum][cbridge], [BSC][cbridge], Cosmos, Polygon, and more. Through the #Build2Earn program, Astar offers a basic income to dApp developers, and direct funding to projects through an *unstoppable grants* program.

## Overview of Docs

- [**Build**](/docs/build) - Provides the resources you need to start building, testing, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on Astar network.
- [**EVM**](/docs/build/evm) - Dives deeper into the EVM on Astar and explains how EVM smart contracts can interact with non-EVM modules and the Wasm virtual machine through [precompiles](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/EVM/precompiles/).
- [**Wasm**](/docs/build/wasm) - Provides an overview of the [Wasm stack](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/wasm/smart-contract-wasm) on Astar, [Wasm contract frameworks](/docs/build/wasm/dsls), and [Swanky Suite](/docs/build/wasm/swanky-suite/).
- [**Nodes**](/docs/build/nodes) - Explains how to run full nodes, collators, indexers, and everything else related to infrastructure.
- [**XCM**](/docs/learn/interoperability/xcm) - Explains how XCM is used in Astar and also how developers can use it to interact with the rest of the Polkadot network.
- [**Integrations**](/docs/build/integrations/) - Provides relevant information about the wallets, indexers, and oracles that are integrated with the network.
- [**Docs Integration Request**](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/astar-docs/blob/main/docs-integration-request.md) - Provides information about how to make a documentation integration request.
