# Getting Started

Astar is the largest smart contract platform in the Polkadot ecosystem, supporting both Wasm and EVM. While providing native access to the Polkadot ecosystem through it's parachain slot, Astar also has bridges into other major ecosystems, including [Ethereum][cbridge], [BSC][cbridge], Cosmos, Polygon, and more. Through the #Build2Earn program, Astar offers a basic income to dApps through inflation, and provides direct funding to projects through the Astar Incubation Program.
