# Getting Started

Astar is a web3 collective building products that bring users onchain and generate long-term value for ASTR. Operating as a multi-chain ecosystem, Astar is anchored by Astar Network, which provides governance, security, and economic alignment. Product development is guided by the Astar Stack, while ASTR serves as the ecosystem’s economic and governance token aligning product growth and onchain activity. Through this integrated approach, Astar aims to accelerate real-world adoption.
