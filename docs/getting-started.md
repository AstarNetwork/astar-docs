# Getting Started

## Introduction

Astar is an interoperable blockchain platform for [**Polkadot**](https://polkadot.com/) and [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org/en/) ecosystems supporting both Wasm and EVM smart contracts. Astar provides native access to Polkadot and Ethereum through its parachain slot and its direct integration with [**Soneium**](https://soneium.org/en/), an *Ethereum Rollup*, while also offering bridges into other major blockchain ecosystems. Through the *#Build2Earn program*, Astar offers a basic income to dApp developers, and direct funding to projects through an *unstoppable grants* program.
