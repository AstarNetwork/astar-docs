# Withdraw Stake From Unregistered Contract

Occasionally but rare, some projects decided to change their contract address on the portal or projects get delisted. In this case, some stakes are not automatically removed. Stakers need to manually withdraw their stake. This tutorial will guide you on how to withdraw your stake from a dApp that has been removed from the portal.

**Most easiest way**, is to connect to the portal with the address that is staking on the unregistered dApp and click on 'Claim'. The moment you click on claim, your bonded tokens will be unlocked and enter unbonding period. In case the above doesn't work, you can follow the guide below.

## Step 1: Find The Contract Address That You Are Staked On
1. Go to [Polkadot.js web app](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate).
2. Make sure you are connected to the correct chain (Astar/Shiden/Shibuya).
3. Make sure you are connected with the correct wallet.
4. Click `Developer` and `Chain State`. 
5. On the left dropdown menu, select `dappsStaking`.
6. On the right dropdown menu, select `generalStakerInfo`.
7. Unselect `include option`.
8. Click the **+** sign.

10. Leave that page as it is.
11. Open another browser tab and go to [Astar Portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/astar/dapp-staking/discover).
12. Connect using the same wallet.
13. Go to dApp Staking -> My dApps.
14. You can see the list of dApps that you are staked on.

16. Cross check the contract addresses with the ones you have on Polkadot.js web app. If you come across a contract address that is available on Polkadot.js web app but not available on Astar Portal, that is the contract address that has been removed, which is what you are looking for.
17. Copy that contract address and paste it on a notepad as a reference for the next steps.

## Step 2: Claim All The Unclaimed Rewards
1. Open a new browser tab and go to [Polkadot.js web app](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/extrinsics).
2. Make sure you are connected to the correct chain (Astar/Shiden/Shibuya).
3. Make sure you are connected with the correct wallet.
4. Click `Developer` and `Extrinsics`. 
5. On the left dropdown menu, select `dappsStaking`.
6. On the right dropdown menu, select `claimStaker`.
7. On EVM: H160, paste the contract address that you have on the notepad e.g `0xaab44542c72f88f7b98fffda418e3efe94bc13af`.
8. Submit transaction and add a tip before signing the transaction.
9. If you have a huge backlog, you need to repeat this step many times until all the rewards are claimed. Otherwise, you won't be able to proceed with the next step.
