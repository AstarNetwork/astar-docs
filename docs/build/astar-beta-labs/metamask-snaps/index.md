# MetaMask Snaps

:::danger Astar Snap Deprecation

**Astar Snap** will soon be deprecated and permanently disabled. This means any assets stored within the Snap will no longer be accessible through it.

To **avoid losing access to your funds**, we strongly recommend that you **migrate your assets as soon as possible** to a supported external wallet, either on **Astar EVM** or **Astar Substrate**.

**What should you do?**

1. Choose a supported wallet from our list (e.g., Polkadot.js, Talisman, MetaMask).
2. Follow the migration steps for the wallet of your choice.
3. Ensure your assets are safely transferred out of Astar Snap.

ðŸ“˜ You can find detailed wallet guides and setup instructions in our [**Getting Started section**](https://docs.astar.network/docs/use/get-started/).

ðŸ‘¾ If you need help, feel free to reach out via our [**Discord community**](https://discord.gg/astarnetwork).

## Overview

MetaMask Snaps allow users to add features and functionality to their MetaMask wallet. Individual snaps are features created by third-party developers that MetaMask users can install directly into their wallet. MetaMask Snaps Open Beta is a first look at what's possible when extending the capabilities of the MetaMask wallet. Snaps run in a sandboxed environment and use a permissions model to protect your data and respect your consent. Snaps donâ€™t have access to your MetaMask account data. When installing a Snap, you can always verify the permissions you are granting.

:::note
Snap-based accounts are derived from the private key associated with your MetaMask account (your seed phrase), so funds cannot be lost even in the event support for a particular Snap is discontinued.
