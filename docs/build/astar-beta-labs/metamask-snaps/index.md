# MetaMask Snaps

## Overview

MetaMask Snaps allows users to add features and functionality to their MetaMask wallet. Individual snaps are features created by third-party developers that MetaMask users can install directly into their wallet. MetaMask Snaps Open Beta is a first look at what's possible when extending the capabilities of the MetaMask wallet. Snaps run in a sandboxed environment and use a permissions model to protect your data and respect your consent. Snaps donâ€™t have access to your MetaMask account data. When installing a Snap, you can always verify the permissions you are granting.
