## Introduction

**Polkadot (DOT)** and **Polkadot Migration** are Ledger-integrated apps that allow users to use a Ledger device as an account and sign transactions for substrate accounts.

- [Release Version `100.0.8` by Zondax](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot/releases/tag/v100.0.8) 

**Ledger Live is not supported hence user will not be able to create Astar accounts with Ledger Live**.

This tutorial describes the process of configuring a Ledger device to manage assets, connect to the Astar portal and participate in dApp staking using native ASTR tokens. It also includes the initiation of the first interaction between the device and the network.

## Your Ledger device is ready for use

- [Make sure you have set up your Ledger device](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000613793?docs=true)
- Update your device to latest firmware
  - [Nano S](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113?docs=true)
  - [Nano S Plus](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4445777839901?docs=true)
  - [Nano X](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800?docs=true)
- [Download and install Ledger Live app for your OS](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389606417-Download-and-install-Ledger-Live?docs=true)
- [Download and install Polkadot.js extension for your browser](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

## Polkadot Migration App

:::info

Due to the new **Polkadot Generic Ledger** application, the **Astar Native Ledger** application is no longer supported by all wallet providers in the ecosystem, including the Polkadot.js extension, and is therefore unusable at the moment. 

To access Astar accounts created with the **Astar Native Ledger** app, users must use the **Polkadot Migration** application. 

:::

:::danger
At the time of this release, **XCM transfers** operations are **NOT SUPPORTED** on Ledger devices for **Polkadot Migration** app.

2. Connect and unlock your Ledger device. If asked, allow `My Ledger` to access your device;
3. Search for **Polkadot Migration** (Version `100.0.8`) in the app catalog;
4. Click Install.

    - *If you have an existing Astar Native Ledger account in your Talisman extension, you must first erase it in order to reimport it using the Polkadot Migration app.*

## Polkadot Generic (DOT) App

:::info

The **Polkadot Generic** app is the standard Ledger application for the Polkadot ecosystem, supporting all Polkadot parachains. New Ledger account users should use the generic Polkadot application directly instead of the **Polkadot Migration** app for a more unified experience.

Now that you have access to your **Astar Ledger** accounts again, you should start thinking about transferring everything (assets, NFT, identities, staking, etc.) to new accounts created with the **Polkadot Generic** app. 

The **Polkadot Migration** app will remain available for an extended period, but it's advisable to migrate to the new generic Polkadot app for a more unified and improved ledger experience on both Polkadot and Astar Network.

## Ledger Troubleshooting

:::tip
If you receive a **Ledger error: Failed to execute 'claimInterface' on 'USBDevice': Unable to claim interface** message during the dApp staking claim process, ensure you are performing the operation:
- Using a Chromium-based browser such as Chrome or Brave,
- The Ledger device connection method is WebHID, as outlined in the previous step
