# OnFinality

## Overview

[OnFinality] is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot community. Its mission is to support blockchain developers by providing infrastructure services so they can focus on building dApps.

OnFinality provides an API service for the Astar ecosystem and is live on all our networks. The initial integration of OnFinality allows users to:

- Query our network RPC and WSS endpoints immediately using OnFinality’s free API service. You can create a free account key allowing up to 500k daily requests to high-performance managed nodes, including nodes for Polkadot and Kusama.
- Quickly stand up dedicated nodes for private access to high-performance WSS and RPC APIs, without needing to manage your own infrastructure.

## Instructions

To create a custom OnFinality endpoint, go to [OnFinality] and sign up, or log in if you have an account already. From the **OnFinality Dashboard**, you can:

1. Click on API Service
2. Select the network from the dropdown
3. Your custom API endpoint will be generated automatically
