### Why do Blockchains Require Oracles?

Blockchains are great at providing immutable storage and deterministically verifiable computations. However, they cannot access trusted real-world information available outside their networks. Oracles enhance smart contract functionality by granting access to reliable data, without relying on centralized authorities, or points of failure.
