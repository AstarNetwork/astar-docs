To make use of this documentation effectively, you should possess a general understanding of programming basics. The programming languages used throughout are mainly Rust and JavaScript, for which previous knowledge is not necessary, but would be highly beneficial. You should also know how to use MetaMask, manage accounts and balances, and interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 

In conjunction with improving your understanding of the material contained within these guides, we recommend that you review supplemental material covering these languages, in order to improve your overall understanding of the topics and the practical code examples provided.
