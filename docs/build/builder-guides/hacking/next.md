# Next step
Here comes the fun! Time to build your own dApp.
Here you will find a list of ideas to implement in any of the smart contract environments.

## Ideas to build
These ideas can be implemented as WASM or EVM smart contract. Main intention is for the ink! developers.

### Pool Together 
Explore this [project](https://app.pooltogether.com/) and build your own version in ink!

### Voting
Use Ink! v4 with Swanky-node to develop a smart contract which allows people to vote The rules are:

* Contract owner initializes a set of candidates (2-10). 
* Lets anyone vote for the candidates.
* Each voter is limited to only one ote (per address).
* Displays the vote totals received by each candidate.

### Tamagotchi
Use Ink! v4 with Swanky-node to create a virtual pet smart contract, allowing users to create, interact with, and trade virtual pets securely and transparently on the blockchain.
Create Tamagotchi: The smart contract should allow users to create a Tamagotchi object with attributes such as hunger, happiness, and energy levels.

* Interact with Tamagotchi: Users should be able to interact with the Tamagotchi object by calling functions to modify its attributes, such as "feed", "play", and "rest".
* Implement Rules: The smart contract should enforce rules and restrictions to prevent users from overfeeding, neglecting, or exploiting the Tamagotchi object.
* Track Lifespan: The smart contract should track the Tamagotchi object's lifespan and trigger events such as death, rebirth, or evolution based on its age, level, and behavior.
* Support Multiple Tamagotchis: The smart contract should support multiple Tamagotchi objects, each with its own set of attributes and state, and allow users to own, trade, or exchange them.
    
### Charity Raffle

Use Ink! v4 from Swanky-node to develop a smart contract which allows people to enter a charity raffle. The rules are:

* A user can send in anywhere between 0.01 and 0.1 tokens.
* A user can only play once.
* A user is added to the pool with one submission, regardless of money that was sent in.
* There can be a maximum of 2 winners.
* The raffle must go on for 15 minutes before a draw can be initiated, but the 15 minute countdown only starts once there are at least 5 players in the pool.
* Anyone can call the draw function at any time, but it will only draw a winner when the 15 minute timer has expired.
* The draw function can be called twice for a maximum of two winners.
* The winners get nothing (itâ€™s a raffle for a real world item, like a t-shirt, so ignore on-chain effects of a win) but they need to be clearly exposed by the contract, i.e. the list of winners has to be a public value dapps and users can read from the contract.
* The collected money from the pot is automatically sent to a pre-defined address when the second winner is drawn.

Happy coding!
