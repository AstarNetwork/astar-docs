# Privy

## Introduction

Privy is the easiest way for web3 developers to onboard their users, regardless of whether they already have wallets, across mobile and desktop. Privy offers [embedded wallets](https://www.privy.io/features/wallets) so you can seamlessly provision self-custodial wallets for users who sign in via email or social login, as well as [powerful connectors](https://www.privy.io/features/connectors) for web3 native users who prefer to sign in with their existing wallets. It’s one library to onboard all users, regardless of where they are in their web3 journey.

Developers building end-user facing applications in the Astar ecosystem can leverage Privy to expand their addressable market, improve onboarding funnel conversion and better understand their users. **For a limited time, Astar developers can get free unlimited access to Privy’s features for their first three months using the product, by reaching out to us at astar@privy.io**. For more information on Privy, check out the [website](http://privy.io), [API docs](http://docs.privy.io), [product demo](http://demo.privy.io), and sample customer integrations ([Lighthouse](http://lighthouse.world/), [Courtyard](http://courtyard.io/), and [Shibuya](http://shibuya.xyz/)).

## Prerequisites

To use Privy in your app, you'll need to:

- Have basic knowledge of JavaScript and React
- Use React 18 in your app
- Use only EVM-compatible networks for any on-chain actions

## Getting started

### Step 1

Request API keys by reaching out to our team at astar@privy.io to ensure you’re able to access Privy’s special offer of three free months of unlimited software use. We'll set you up with a [Privy app ID](https://docs.privy.io/guide/console/api-keys#app-id) that you can use to initialize the SDK.

### Step 2

Install the **[Privy React Auth SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@privy-io/react-auth)** using `npm`:

`npm install @privy-io/react-auth@latest`

### Step 3

Once you have your app ID and have installed the SDK, **in your React project, wrap your components with a [PrivyProvider](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/modules#privyprovider)**. The [PrivyProvider](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/modules#privyprovider) should wrap any component that will use the Privy SDK.

For example, in a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) project, you may wrap your components like so:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nextjs" label="NextJS">

```tsx title=_app.jsx
import type {AppProps} from 'next/app';
import Head from 'next/head';
import {PrivyProvider} from '@privy-io/react-auth';

// This method will be passed to the PrivyProvider as a callback
// that runs after successful login.
const handleLogin = (user) => {
  console.log(`User ${user.id} logged in!`)
}

function MyApp({Component, pageProps}: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        {/* Edit your HTML header */}
      </Head>
      <PrivyProvider
        appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID}
        onSuccess={handleLogin}
        config={{
          loginMethods: ['email', 'wallet'],
          appearance: {
            theme: 'light',
            accentColor: '#676FFF',
            logo: 'https://your-logo-url',
          },
        }}
      >
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </PrivyProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cra" label="Create React App">

```tsx title=index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import {PrivyProvider} from '@privy-io/react-auth';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

// This method will be passed to the PrivyProvider as a callback
// that runs after successful login.
const handleLogin = (user) => {
  console.log(`User ${user.id} logged in!`)
}

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PrivyProvider
      appId={process.env.REACT_APP_PRIVY_APP_ID}
      onSuccess={handleLogin}
      config={{
        loginMethods: ['email', 'wallet'],
        appearance: {
          theme: 'light',
          accentColor: '#676FFF',
          logo: 'https://your-logo-url',
        },
      }}
    >
      <App />
    </PrivyProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// See https://docs.privy.io/guide/troubleshooting/webpack for how to handle
// common build issues with web3 projects bootstrapped with Create React App
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The [PrivyProvider](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/modules#privyprovider) takes the following properties:

- your [appId](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/interfaces/PrivyProviderProps#appid)
- an optional [onSuccess](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/interfaces/PrivyProviderProps#onsuccess) callback which will execute once a user successfully logs in
- an optional [createPrivyWalletOnLogin](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/interfaces/PrivyProviderProps#createprivywalletonlogin) boolean to configure whether you'd like your users to create [embedded wallets](https://docs.privy.io/guide/frontend/embedded/overview) when logging in
- an optional [config](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/modules#privyclientconfig) property to customize your onboarding experience.
    - The example above will set you up with email and wallet logins.
    - See [this page](https://docs.privy.io/guide/configuration/) for more on how to construct the right [config](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/modules#privyclientconfig) for your app!

### Step 4

**You can now use the Privy SDK throughout your app via the [usePrivy](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/modules#useprivy) hook!** Check out our [starter repo](https://github.com/privy-io/next-starter) to see what a simple end-to-end integration looks like.

Read on to learn how you can use Privy to:

- [log your users in](https://docs.privy.io/guide/frontend/authentication/login)
- [prompt users to link additional accounts](https://docs.privy.io/guide/frontend/users/linking), as part of progressive onboarding
- [interface with users' crypto wallets](https://docs.privy.io/guide/frontend/wallets/external)
- [create Ethereum wallets embedded in your app](https://docs.privy.io/guide/frontend/embedded/overview)

and to do so much more!

## Troubleshooting

If you're using a framework like [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to build your project, you may encounter errors related to [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/). To resolve, check out [this guide](https://docs.privy.io/guide/troubleshooting/webpack).
