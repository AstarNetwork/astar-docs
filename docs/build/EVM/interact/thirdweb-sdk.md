# thirdweb SDK

## Introduction

thirdweb is a complete web3 development framework that provides everything you need to connect your apps and games to decentralized networks

## Prerequisites

1. Latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Astar network wallet set up with basic usage knowledge.
3. Basic knowledge of React.

## Getting started

### Creating an app

thirdweb provides several SDKs to allow you to interact with your contract including: [React](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react), [React Native](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react-native), [TypeScript](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript), [Python](https://portal.thirdweb.com/python), [Go](https://portal.thirdweb.com/go), and [Unity](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity).

This document will show you how to interact with your contract deployed to Astar using React

> View the [full React SDK reference](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) in thirdweb’s documentation.

To create a new application pre-configured with thirdweb’s SDKs run and choose your preferred configurations:

```jsx
npx thirdweb create app --evm
```

or install it into your existing project by running:

```jsx
npx thirdweb install
```

### Initialize SDK on Astar

Wrap your application in the `ThirdwebProvider` component and change the `activeChain` to Astar

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Astar } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider activeChain={Astar}>
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

### Get contract

To connect to your contract, use the SDK’s [`getContract`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.getcontract) method.

```jsx
import { useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const { contract, isLoading, error } = useContract("{{contract_address}}");
}
```

### Calling contract functions

- For extension based functions, use the built-in supported hooks. The following is an example using the NFTs extension to access a list of NFTs owned by an address- `useOwnedNFTs`

  ```jsx
  import { useOwnedNFTs, useContract, useAddress } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

  // Your smart contract address
  const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

  function App() {
    const address = useAddress();
    const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
    const { data, isLoading, error } = useOwnedNFTs(contract, address);
  }
  ```

- Use the `useContractRead` hook to call any read functions on your contract by passing in the name of the function you want to use.

  ```jsx
  import { useContractRead, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

  // Your smart contract address
  const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

  function App() {
    const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
    const { data, isLoading, error } = useContractRead(contract, "getName");
  }
  ```

- Use the `useContractWrite` hook to call any writefunctions on your contract by passing in the name of the function you want to use.

  ```jsx
  import {
    useContractWrite,
    useContract,
    Web3Button,
  } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

  // Your smart contract address
  const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

  function App() {
    const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
    const { mutateAsync, isLoading, error } = useContractWrite(
      contract,
      "setName"
    );

    return (
      <Web3Button
        contractAddress={contractAddress}
        // Calls the "setName" function on your smart contract with "My Name" as the first argument
        action={() => mutateAsync({ args: ["My Name"] })}
      >
        Send Transaction
      </Web3Button>
    );
  }
  ```

### Connect Wallet

Create a custom connect wallet experience by declaring supported wallets passed to your provider.

```jsx
import {
  ThirdwebProvider,
  metamaskWallet,
  coinbaseWallet,
  walletConnectV1,
  walletConnect,
  safeWallet,
  paperWallet,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      supportedWallets={[
        metamaskWallet(),
        coinbaseWallet(),
        walletConnect({
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", // optional
        }),
        walletConnectV1(),
        safeWallet(),
        paperWallet({
          clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // required
        }),
      ]}
      activeChain={Astar}
    >
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

Add in a connect wallet button to prompt end-users to login with any of the above supported wallets.

```jsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  return <ConnectWallet />;
}
```
