## How to bridge

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to bridge USDT from Ethereum to Astar. By doing so, you will be adding liquidity to our network, which benefits the ecosystem overall, and for which we convey our deepest gratitude.

**Reminder:**

- The minimum cross-chain amount is 40 USDT
- The maximum cross-chain amount is 5.000.000 USDT
- Estimated time of cross-chain arrival is 10-30 min
- An amount larger than 1.000.000 USDT could take up to 12 hours

### Step 1

Visit the following website: <https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge> and connect your MetaMask. Select the Ethereum network.

We will transfer USDT on ETH (mainnet) -> USDT on Astar (mainnet).

### Step 2

Click on '**Swap**' to initiate the transfer. You will receive a popup, and need to click on '**Swap**' again, after which, MetaMask will open for you to sign the transaction.

### Step 3

In the top-right corner, you will see that your transaction is pending. This can take 15-30 minutes.
