## 1. Overview

The **Astar Portal** also serves as the **main faucet** for the entire **Astar Network ecosystem** and its networks (Testnet → **Shibuya**, Canary Network → **Shiden**). Through it, you can obtain test tokens for the Shibuya network, or a small amount on Shiden and Astar Network to cover the gas fees for your first transactions. This ensures that your initial funds never get stuck due to a lack of ASTR for gas.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to get some **SBY** tokens from the **Astar Portal** using the [**Zerion**](https://zerion.io/) wallet. To complete this tutorial, you’ll need:

- A wallet that supports the **EVM** format (we’ll use Zerion)
- An existing Astar EVM account

:::tip Wallet Setup

To set up your wallet on Astar Network, follow → [**this guide**](/docs/use/get-started/index.md).

:::info Astar & Shiden

This guide will also work for ASTR and SDN assets on Astar and Shiden networks.

We’ll now walk through the full get test tokens process step by step.

## 2. Guide to Get Test Tokens

### Step 1: Connect to Shibuya Network

Go to our [**Astar Portal**](https://portal.astar.network/astar/assets), the site where you can manage your funds and accounts within **Astar Network**.

Switch from the **Astar Network** to the **Astar Testnet**.

### Step 2: Connect EVM wallet

Click on **Select wallet**.

Choose the wallet you use, in this case, it will be **Zerion**, so we’ll click on **Metamask** to open the modal and connect it.

:::info Metamask Mode

Zerion uses a mode called Metamask mode, where every request made to Metamask is handled by Zerion first. That’s why we click on Metamask, as the Zerion logo doesn’t appear directly.

### Step 3: Get SBY tokens

Once connected, in your dashboard, click the **Faucet** button.

<Figure caption="" src={require('/docs/build/environment/img/get-test-tokens/get-test-tokens-5.png').default} width="100%" />

Click the checkbox to verify you're human and confirm.

If everything is correct, you’ll see a message confirming that the transaction was successfully executed, and you’ll be able to view your transaction in the block explorer.

Verify that you've received the amount successfully.
