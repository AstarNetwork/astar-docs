# ink! Environment
## Overview

This guide is designed for those who are getting started with ink! or Wasm smart contracts in the Astar ecosystem. Before you can get started you need to make sure your environment supports Rust.

---

## What is Ink!

Ink! is a Rust eDSL developed by Parity, that specifically targets smart contract development for Substrate’s `pallet-contracts`. Ink! is not trying to invent a new programming language, but rather, adapting a subset of Rust to serve smart contract developers, specifically. If this isn't reason enough on its own to convince you to learn more about ink!, you can find many more [here](https://use.ink/why-rust-for-smart-contracts). 

Another frequently asked question when discussing Wasm smart contracts is: Why use WebAssembly for smart contracts? You can find all the answers [here](https://use.ink/why-webassembly-for-smart-contracts).

## Ink! Environment Setup

### Rust and Cargo

Rust and Cargo are prerequisites for compiling Wasm smart contracts. The easiest way to obtain Cargo is to install the current stable release of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Installing Rust using `rustup` will also install `cargo`. On Linux and macOS systems, you can do that as follows:

```rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

This will download a script and start the installation. If you are using Windows, visit the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions to install Rust. Configure source control to pull the latest stable release and add nightly + Wasm target.

```bash
rustup default stable
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup component add rust-src
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

### Ink! [CLI](https://use.ink/getting-started/setup#ink-cli)

The first and most important tool we will be installing is [cargo-contract](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract), a CLI tool for setting up and managing WebAssembly smart contracts written with ink! 

As a prerequisite, you will need to install the [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) package, used to optimize WebAssembly contract bytecode.

Two other dependencies need to be satisfied to link the ink! contract, for example to warn users about using API's in a way that could lead to security issues.

```rust
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
```

Many package managers have it available nowadays ‒ e.g., there is a package for [Debian/Ubuntu](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/binaryen), [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/binaryen), and [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/binaryen/). After you've installed the package, execute:

```rust
cargo install cargo-contract --force --locked
```

Use `--force` to ensure you are updated to the most recent `cargo-contract` version.

You can then use `cargo contract --help` to start exploring the commands made available to you.
