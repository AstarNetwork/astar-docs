# Swanky Dev Container


Together with the `swanky-cli` tool, you can have the entire environment preinstalled and preconfigured inside a Docker container.

To use this setup, you need Visual Studio Code and a running Docker engine. 

Detailed instructions on how to configure and utilize the Dev Container can be found on the [swanky-dev-container Github](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-dev-container)."
