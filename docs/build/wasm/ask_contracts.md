# Ask! Smart Contracts

:::caution

Ask! eDSL has many [limitations and issues](https://github.com/ask-lang/ask/issues/)
which are actively worked upon but at this moment it is not recommended
for **PRODUCTION** environment. Please consider [ink!](dsls#ink) if you are building a contract for production.

:::

This guide will help you set up your local environment and deploy a simple Ask! contract on our testnet, Shibuya.

---

## What will we do?

We will setup the local environment for developing ask! smart contract and deploys it Shibuya Testnet.

## What is Ask!?

Ask! is a framework for AssemblyScript developers to write Wasm smart contracts for `pallet-contracts`, otherwise known as the Wasm Virtual Machine. Its syntax is similar to TypeScript. The [current project](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/949) is funded by Polkadot treasury, and still under active development. 

---

## Prerequisites

This tutorial targets developers who are new to ask! and AssemblyScript.
Prior knowledge of using/setting up typescript/javascript project is helpful but not needed.

## Setup Environment

#### Install yarn package manager.

We will be using `yarn` package manager to manage our ask! project. For installation instructions [read here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

```
npm install --global yarn
```

#### Clone the `ask-template` repo

Simply clone the template provided by ask! team - `ask-template`.
Execute the below commands to clone the repository and cd into it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ask-lang/ask-template.git
cd ask-template
```

After executing above commands you will have a following project structure.

```
ask-template
├── asconfig.json               (assemblyscript config)
├── askconfig.json              (ask-lang config)
├── build                       (build targets, configurable, see asconfig.json and askconfig.json)
│   └── metadata.json           (Ask! contract metadata)
├── flipper.ts                  (Ask! contract code)
├── index.d.ts                  (typescript definition file, used for syntax and code hinting)
├── LICENSE
├── node_modules
├── package.json                (npm package config)
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.json               (typescript config)
└── yarn.lock
```

The command above sets you a simple Ask! contract in `flipper.ts`. You are good to go now!

## Flipper Contract

### `flipper.ts` file

Below is the content of `flipper.ts` file. It contains a very basic flipper contract which has only two contract methods, `flip()`
and `get()`.

```ts
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-inferrable-types */
import { env, Pack } from "ask-lang";

@event({ id: 1 })
export class FlipEvent {
  flag: bool;

  constructor(flag: bool) {
    this.flag = flag;
  }
}

@spreadLayout
@packedLayout
export class Flipper {
  flag: bool;
  constructor(flag: bool = false) {
    this.flag = flag;
  }
}

@contract
export class Contract {
  _data: Pack<Flipper>;

  constructor() {
    this._data = instantiate<Pack<Flipper>>(new Flipper(false));
  }

  get data(): Flipper {
    return this._data.unwrap();
  }

  set data(data: Flipper) {
    this._data = new Pack(data);
  }

  @constructor()
  default(flag: bool): void {
    this.data.flag = flag;
  }

  @message({ mutates: true })
  flip(): void {
    this.data.flag = !this.data.flag;
    let event = new FlipEvent(this.data.flag);
    // @ts-ignore
    env().emitEvent(event);
  }

  @message()
  get(): bool {
    return this.data.flag;
  }
}
```

### Contract Structure

```ts
/*
 * @event() is use to define Event, that can be emitted using env().emitEvent().
 */
@event({ id: 1 })
export class FlipEvent {}

/*
 * This is the smart contract storage
 */
@spreadLayout
@packedLayout
export class Flipper {}

/*
 * @contract is use declare a smart contract, contains the functional logic.
 */
@contract
export class Contract {}
```

#### Storage

```ts
@spreadLayout
@packedLayout
export class Flipper {
  flag: bool;
  constructor(flag: bool = false) {
    this.flag = flag;
  }
}
```

The `Flipper` class is our contract's storage. The `@spreadLayout` and `@packedLayout` are used to describe how it will
be stored internally, see for more details - [here](https://use.ink/3.x/datastructures/spread-storage-layout).

#### Callable functions

```ts
@contract
export class Contract {
  @constructor()
  default(flag: bool): void {}

  @message({ mutates: true })
  flip(): void {}

  @message()
  get(): bool {}
}
```

- `@constructor` - This is used for bootstrapping the initial contract state into the storage when contract is deployed for first time.

- `@message()` - This marks a function as publicly dispatchable, meaning that it is exposed in the contract interface to the outside world.

#### Events

Events in ask! are simple classes that are anointed with `@event()` decorator with id specified.

Note:- No two events can have same id

```ts
@event({ id: 1 })
export class FlipEvent {
  flag: bool;

  constructor(flag: bool) {
    this.flag = flag;
  }
}
```

`env().emitEvent()` is used to emit events in ask!, just like in `flip()` method of contract.

```ts
let event = new FlipEvent(this.data.flag);
// @ts-ignore
env().emitEvent(event);
```

## Build

Run the command below, which will build the template contract.
```bash
# Install dependencies and Build the template contract
yarn && yarn build flipper.ts
```

The above command will generate the Wasm code and metadata file for the contract in `flipper.optimized.wasm`, and `metadata.json`, respectively.

```
ask-template
├── asconfig.json               (assemblyscript config)
├── askconfig.json              (ask-lang config)
├── build
│   └── metadata.json           generated by Ask!, configurable by `askconfig.json`
│   └── flipper.optimized.wasm  generated by AssemblyScript, configurable by `asconfig.json`
│   └── flipper.wat             generated by AssemblyScript, configurable by `asconfig.json`
```

## Deploy

Now we will deploy this smart contract on our testnet.

We will access [polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) and deploy the smart contract. Select Shibuya testnet and pick `metadata.json` for “json for either ABI or .contract bundle” section and pick `flipper.optimized.wasm` for “compiled contract WASM” section.

After following the steps above. We can confirm that the contract is deployed on Shibuya testnet.

That’s a wrap!
