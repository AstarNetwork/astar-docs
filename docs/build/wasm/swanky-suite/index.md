# Swanky Suite

Swanky Suite aims to be an "all-in-one" tool for Wasm smart contract developers. It is based on existing tools like` cargo contract CLI` and `polkadot.js` but extends their functionality with many additional features such as smart contract templates, and an instant finality (Swanky) node, which reduces the contract development lifecycle. Swanky Suite is a tool that provides Web3 developers with an experience that is more in-line with what they're familiar with, compared to popular tooling for EVM.

Swanky Suite offers an extensible set of features, allowing developers to:

- Quickly spin up a local contract development node with instant finality (Swanky Node).
- Easily scaffold new projects using templates for both smart contracts and front-end dApps. ie. Truffle for ink!
- Compile projects in various languages (like Ink!, Ask-Lite, â€¦).
- Facilitate RPC and integration testing via npm for interacting with smart contracts on the client-side.
- Handle and manage network accounts.
- Deploy smart contracts within the Polkadot ecosystem to networks that support `pallet-contracts`.
- Make arbitrary calls to live smart contracts.

## Architecture Overview

The Swanky Suite consists of two parts, Swanky CLI and Swanky Node.

The source code for both Swanky CLI and Swanky Node are hosted on GitHub:

- [Swanky CLI](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-cli).
- [Swanky Node](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-node).

The architecture envisioned for Swanky CLI and Swanky Node (Local developer node):
