# Swanky Suite

Swanky Suite aims to be an "all-in-one" tool for Wasm smart contract developers. It is based on existing tools like` cargo contract CLI` and `polkadot.js` but extends their functionality with many additional features such as smart contract templates, and an instant finality (Swanky) node, which reduces the contract development lifecycle. Swanky Suite is a tool that provides Web3 developers with an experience that is more in-line with what they're familiar with, compared to popular tooling for EVM.

Swanky Suite offers an extensible set of features, allowing developers to:

- Quickly spin up a local contract development node with instant finality (Swanky Node).
- Easily scaffold new projects using templates for both smart contracts and front-end dApps. ie. Truffle for ink!
- Compile projects in various languages (like Ink!, Ask-Lite, â€¦).
- Facilitate RPC and integration testing via npm for interacting with smart contracts on the client-side.
- Handle and manage network accounts.
- Deploy smart contracts within the Polkadot ecosystem to networks that support `pallet-contracts`.
- Make arbitrary calls to live smart contracts.

## Architecture Overview

The Swanky Suite consists of two parts, Swanky CLI and Swanky Node.

The source code for both Swanky CLI and Swanky Node are hosted on GitHub:

- [Swanky CLI](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-cli).
- [Swanky Node](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-node).

The architecture envisioned for Swanky CLI and Swanky Node (Local developer node):

## Swanky CLI

Swanky CLI is a Node.js CLI app that uses Polkadot.js API on the backend, alongside many existing tools, such as the `cargo contract` CLI. In the future, there will be many additional features to support developers, such as Wasm dApp bootstrapping via smart contract and UI scaffolding, integration tests, management of local nodes, account management, connecting and deploying contracts to both local and remote networks, compiling for various languages from a single CLI app, compatibility checks between the contract pallet and compiler, and much more.

### Installing

The CLI can be installed through:
* dev-container
* Binary download
* npm package

:::note
Note that using the precompiled binaries, NPM, or compiling it yourself requires you to have the [local environment set up](../environment/ink_environment.md) correctly
:::

#### Dev container (Recommended)

Using [dev container](docs/build/environment/dev-container) is the recommended method to use `swanky-cli`, it includes all the environment setup and will support auto-updates in the future.

To run your project in the dev container follow the steps on [swanky-dev-container Github](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-dev-container).

#### Download the Precompiled Binaries

1. Download the correct archive for your platform from the [releases section of swanky-cli github page](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-cli/releases).

2. Extract the archive to the appropriate location, for example the `software` directory.

3. Add the `swanky` executable to your path variable by creating a symbolic link to it from a common `bin` directory or somewhere similar.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="MacOS" label="MacOS" default>

```sh
ln -s /Users/my_name/software/swanky-cli/bin/swanky /usr/local/bin
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Debian/Ubuntu" label="Debian/Ubuntu">

```sh
ln -s /home/my_name/swanky-cli/bin/swanky /usr/local/bin
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Globally with npm

This approach may seem simpler, but due to the nature of `Node.js` dependency management, may result in version inconsistency or other errors.

```sh-session
$ npm install -g @astar-network/swanky-cli
```

or

```sh-session
$ npx @astar-network/swanky-cli [command]
```

### Swanky-cli Commands

#### `swanky help`

Display help and usage examples for Swanky commands and subcommands.

```
USAGE
  $ swanky help [COMMAND] [-n]

ARGUMENTS
  COMMAND  Command to show help for.

FLAGS
  -n, --nested-commands  Include all nested commands in the output.

DESCRIPTION
  Display help for swanky.
```

#### `swanky init`

Scaffold a new Wasm project.

```
USAGE
  $ swanky init [PROJECTNAME] [--swanky-node] [--template blank|flipper|psp22] [-v]

ARGUMENTS
  PROJECTNAME  directory name of new project

  --template=<option>  <options: blank|flipper|psp22>

DESCRIPTION
  Generate a new smart contract environment
```

<Figure caption="Initiate a project" src={require('./img/01-init.gif').default} />

After responding to the prompts, Swanky will modify the templates, download the node, and run the appropriate installation scripts.
The resulting folder structure should look something like this:

<Figure caption="Folder structure" src={require('./img/01a-folder_structure.png').default} />

#### `swanky check`

Verify the dependencies needed to run the Swanky project.

```
USAGE
  $ swanky check

DESCRIPTION
  Check installed package versions and compatibility
```

<Figure caption="Verify dependencies" src={require('./img/02-check.gif').default} />

:::note
For now, you will need to be be in a project folder to run this command.
:::

## Swanky Node

Swanky Node is a Substrate based blockchain configured to enable `pallet-contracts` (a smart contract module), and other features that assist local development of Wasm smart contracts.

### Features

- [pallet-contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts)
- `grandpa` & `aura` consensus were removed. Instead, `instant-seal` & `manual-seal` are used.
  Blocks are authored & finalized (1) as soon as a transaction get in the pool (2) when `engine_createBlock` `engine_finalizeBlock` RPC called respectively.
- `pallet-dapps-staking`
- `pallet-assets`
- `pallet-assets` chain extension
- `pallet-dapps-staking` chain extension

Swanky Node is optimized for local development, while removing unnecessary components such as P2P. Additional features and pallets, such as to interact between (Contract <-> Runtime), will be added in the future.

### Compatible ink! version

ink! `v4.0.0` or lower is supported.

### Installation

#### Download Binary

The easiest method of installation is by downloading and executing a precompiled binary from the [Release Page](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-node/releases)

#### Build Locally

If you would like to build the source locally, you should first complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](/docs/build/environment/ink_environment#rust-and-cargo).
Once Rust is installed and configured, you will be able to build the node with:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs :book:

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```bash
./target/release/swanky-node -h
```

### Usage

This command will start the single-node development chain with a persistent state.

```bash
./target/release/swanky-node
```

If you would prefer to run the node in non-persistent mode, use tmp option.

```
./target/release/swanky-node --tmp
# or
./target/release/swanky-node --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state.

```bash
./target/release/swanky-node purge-chain
```
### Development Accounts
The **alice** development account will be the authority and sudo account as declared in the
[genesis state](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-node/blob/main/node/src/chain_spec.rs#L44).
While at the same time, the following accounts will be pre-funded:

- Alice
- Bob
- Charlie
- Dave
- Eve
- Ferdie
- Alice//stash
- Bob//stash
- Charlie//stash
- Dave//stash
- Eve//stash
- Ferdie//stash

### Show only Errors and Contract Debug Output

To print errors and contract debug output to the console log, supply `-lerror,runtime::contracts=debug` when starting the node.

```
./target/release/swanky-node -lerror,runtime::contracts=debug
```

Important: Debug output is only printed for RPC calls or off-chain tests â€’ not for transactions.

See the ink! [FAQ](https://ink.substrate.io/faq/#how-do-i-print-something-to-the-console-from-the-runtime) for more details: How do I print something to the console from the runtime?.

### Connect with Polkadot.js Apps Portal

Once the Swanky Node is running locally, you will be able to connect to it from the **Polkadot-JS Apps** front-end,
in order to interact with your chain. [Click
here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) connecting the Apps to your
local Swanky Node.

### Run in Docker

First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then run the following command to start a single node development chain.

```bash
mkdir .local # this is mounted by container
./scripts/docker_run.sh
```

This command will compile the code, and then start a local development network. You can
also replace the default command
(`cargo build --release && ./target/release/swanky-node --dev --ws-external`)
by appending your own. A few useful commands are shown below:

```bash
# Run Substrate node without re-compiling
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/swanky-node --ws-external

# Purge the local dev chain
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/swanky-node purge-chain

# Check whether the code is compilable
./scripts/docker_run.sh cargo check
```

### Consensus (Manual Seal & Instant Seal)

Unlike other blockchains, Swanky Node adopts block authoring and finality gadgets referred to as Manual Seal and Instant Seal, consensus mechanisms suitable for contract development and testing.

Manual seal - Blocks are authored whenever RPC is called.
Instant seal - Blocks are authored as soon as transactions enter the pool, most often resulting in one transaction per block.

Swanky Node enables both Manual seal and Instant seal.

#### Manual Sealing via RPC call

We can tell the node to author a block by calling the `engine_createBlock` RPC.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d   '{
     "jsonrpc":"2.0",
      "id":1,
      "method":"engine_createBlock",
      "params": [true, false, null]
    }'
```

#### Params

- **Create Empty**
  `create_empty` is a Boolean value indicating whether empty blocks may be created. Setting `create-empty` to true does not mean that an empty block will necessarily be created. Rather, it means that the engine should go ahead creating a block even if no transactions are present. If transactions are present in the queue, they will be included regardless of the value of `create_empty`.

- **Finalize**
  `finalize` is a Boolean value indicating whether the block (and its ancestors, recursively) should be finalized after creation.

- **Parent Hash**
  `parent_hash` is an optional hash of a block to use as a parent. To set the parent, use the format `"0x0e0626477621754200486f323e3858cd5f28fcbe52c69b2581aecb622e384764"`. To omit the parent, use `null`. When the parent is omitted the block will be built on the current best block. Manually specifying the parent is useful for constructing fork scenarios, and demonstrating chain reorganizations.

#### Finalizing Blocks Manually

In addition to finalizing blocks at the time of creating them, they may also be finalized later by using the RPC call `engine_finalizeBlock`.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d   '{
     "jsonrpc":"2.0",
      "id":1,
      "method":"engine_finalizeBlock",
      "params": ["0x0e0626477621754200486f323e3858cd5f28fcbe52c69b2581aecb622e384764", null]
    }'
```
