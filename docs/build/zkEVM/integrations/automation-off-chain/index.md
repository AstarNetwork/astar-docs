# Automation & Off-chain Data
 
One of the challenges when developing blockchain dApps is the lack of auto-execute methods calls by smart contracts. 

Automations solutions check on-chain and off-chain for predefined condtions and when this conditions are met, execute the required transactions. 
Auto harvesting, executing prediction rounds, limit orders or pull oracles are examples of automation.


```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
