# NFT API
An NFT API comprises a set of REST APIs enabling the indexing of NFT data such as NFT balances and metadata available on Astar zkEVM network.

Designed to deliver well-organized and top-tier NFT data, the NFT API empowers developers to construct applications interacting with diverse NFT types like ERC721, ERC115, and more.

Hence, the NFT API finds optimal utility in, but is not restricted to, the following scenarios:

* Portfolio dashboards
* Wallet applications
* NFT-gating applications
* NFT marketplaces

Here are providers of NFT APIs on Astar zkEVM testnet and mainnet.
