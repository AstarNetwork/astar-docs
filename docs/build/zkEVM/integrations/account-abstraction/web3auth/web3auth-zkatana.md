# Integrate Web3Auth with Astar zkEVM

While using the Web3Auth Web SDK, you get access to a EIP1193 provider, similar to the Metamask Provider. This provider can be used with libraries like web3.js, ethers.js etc. to make zKyoto blockchain calls for the purpose of getting the user's account info, fetching balances, signing transactions, sending transactions, reading from and writing to smart contracts, etc. 

For more information about how to use Web3Auth on Astar zkEVM, please consult their [official documentation.](https://web3auth.io/docs/connect-blockchain/evm/zkevm/)
