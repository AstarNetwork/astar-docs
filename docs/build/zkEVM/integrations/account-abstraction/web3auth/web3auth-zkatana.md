# Integrate Web3Auth with the zKatana Blockchain

While using the Web3Auth Web SDK, you receive a EIP1193 provider, similar to the Metamask Provider. This provider can be used with libraries like web3.js, ethers.js etc. to make zKatana blockchain calls such as getting the user's account, fetching balances, signing transaction, sending transaction, reading from and writing to smart contract, etc. 

For more information about how to use Web3Auth on zKatana testnet, please consult their [official documentation.](https://web3auth.io/docs/connect-blockchain/zkatana)
