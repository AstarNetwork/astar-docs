# SubQuery

## What is SubQuery?

SubQuery is an open-source and universal blockchain data indexer for developers that provides fast, flexible, reliable, and decentralised APIs to power leading multi-chain apps. Our goal is to save developers time and money by eliminating the need of building their own indexing solution and instead, fully focus on developing their applications.

SubQuery's superior indexing capabilities support Astar smart contracts all out of the box. (In reality a Docker container!) Starter projects are provided allowing developers to get up and running and index blockchain data in minutes.

Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics or multi-chain block scanners.

Other advantages include superior performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture. To find out more, visit our documentation.
