# DipDup

[DipDup](https://dipdup.io) is a Python framework for building smart contract indexers. It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://dipdup.io/docs/supported-networks/astar) or follow the [quickstart](https://dipdup.io/docs/quickstart-evm) guide.
