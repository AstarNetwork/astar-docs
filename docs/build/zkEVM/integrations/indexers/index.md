# Indexers

## Overview

Here you will find all the information required to use GraphQL data sources and indexers on Astar zkEVM.

## GraphQL Data Sources and Indexers

Blockchain developers are often faced with the challenge of obtaining data from various API and data sources. Traditional methods may involve directly interacting with each network's API, which can be time-consuming and complex. However, leveraging GraphQL data sources simplifies this process, enabling developers to fetch data from multiple sources seamlessly.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It provides an efficient and powerful alternative to REST and offers significant advantages when dealing with complex data models.

GraphQL allows clients to define the structure of the responses they receive. This means that instead of receiving a fixed data structure from a server, clients can request specific data they need, leading to more efficient data loading and a reduction in data over-fetching.

## Custom Indexing

Take a look at any of the following for your own custom GraphQL indexing needs:

<br/>

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
