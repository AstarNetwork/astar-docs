# Oracles

## Overview

Blockchain oracles are third-party services or agents that provide smart contracts with external information and serve as bridges between blockchains and the external world. Because blockchains cannot access external data (outside of their network) due to their secure and deterministic nature, oracles are used to fetch, verify, and relay real-world data to smart contracts in a way that's trustworthy.
