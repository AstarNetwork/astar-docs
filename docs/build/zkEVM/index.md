## What is Astar zkEVM? 

Astar zkEVM is a Layer-2 scaling solution leveraging Polygon's zero-knowledge technology and Aggregation Layer (AggLayer) to facilitate off-chain execution and data availability, otherwise known as a **Validium**, with finality guaranteed by Ethereum. This approach synthesizes the benefits of both fully integrated (monolithic) as well modular architectures, combining the best features of each. 

Astar zkEVM serves as a versatile solution for global enterprises, accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology not only in Japan, but on a global scale. 

In coordination with our key partners, Astar zkEVM is well-positioned to take advantage of the extensive developer base and well-established toolset existing in the Ethereum ecosystem, and boasts the following key features:

- **Some of the lowest transaction fees in the Ethereum ecosystem** - Off-chain transaction batching and data availability provides some of the lowest costs for transacting in the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Full EVM-equivalence** - Smart contracts that work on Ethereum also work on Astar zkEVM.
- **Native Account Abstraction** - The Astar zkEVM provides native features designed to revolutionize the end-user experience and make it seamless.
- **Top-Tier Infrastructure Integrations** - Established names and brands that developers trust power the Astar zkEVM. 
- **Interoperability and Exposure** - With Astar zkEVM, we are supporting interoperability between the Ethereum, Polkadot, and Polygon ecosystems, uniting communities through a common vision.
- **Established Tools and Libraries** - The zkEVM is compatible with tools and libraries developers already know how to use, such as Remix, Hardhat, and Open Zeppelin.
