# Tokenomics 2.0

As the network evolves, so do our tokenomics. Astar Network's tokenomics are being revised to best serve the needs of network participants, from users and builders to enterprise partners. With Tokenomics 2.0, you can expect a sustainable token structure and a lower inflation rate.

:::info
Astar Network is currently in a phased transition to a Tokenomics 2.0 model.

Sections within this chapter describe current status of tokenomics and content will be added as changes get enacted (go live) on Astar Network.

Overview of current Tokenomics are documented [here](../tokenomics)

The overview of Astar Network Tokenomics 2.0 plans and current discussion on the topic can be found on [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/t/astar-tokenomics-2-0-a-dynamically-adjusted-inflation/4924)
