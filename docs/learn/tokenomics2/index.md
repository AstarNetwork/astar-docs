# Tokenomics 2.0

Astar Network's tokenomics has been revised to best serve the needs of network participants, from users and builders to enterprise partners.

Tokenomics 2.0 introduce a sustainable token allocation structure and network fees as well as a lower inflation rate.

:::info
Astar Network is currently in a phased transition to a Tokenomics 2.0 model. The overview of Tokenomics 2.0 plans and discussions on the topic can be found on [Astar Forum](https://forum.astar.network/t/astar-tokenomics-2-0-a-dynamically-adjusted-inflation/4924)

Content to this section will be added as changes get enacted (go live).

Overview of current Astar Network's Tokenomics are documented **[here](../tokenomics)**

The outline of the phased approach to Tokenomics 2.0:
- Phase 0 - Forum Discussion: 
    - ✅ ongoing throughtout all phases
- Phase 1 - Fee Ajdustments:
    - ✅ Shibuya testnet - live since October 2023
    - ✅ Shiden - live since November 2023
    - ✅ Astar - live since November 2023
- Phase 2 - Hybrid Inflation Model (Reduction of collators' reward and treasury reward, reduction of inflation)
    - ✅ Shibuya testnet - live since November 2023
    - Shiden - parameters defined, implementation in progress
    - Astar - parameters defined, implementation in progress
- Phase 3 - Full Inflation Model (activation of dAppStaking v3 which affects block reward calculation, further reduction of inflation)
    - Shibuya testnet - parameters defined, implementation in progress
    - Shiden - parameters defined, implementation in progress
    - Astar - parameters defined, implementation in progress

:::tip
Astar, Shiden and Shibuya share the same economic model, however configuration differences exist. Following chapters focus on Astar (ASTR token) but also apply to Shiden (SDN token) and Shibuya (SBY token).
