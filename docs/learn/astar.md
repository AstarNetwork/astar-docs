# About Astar

## What is Astar?

Astar is a collective driving Web3 adoption, seamlessly bridging [**Astar Network**](https://astar.network) and [**Soneium**](https://soneium.org) ecosystems. By combining the strengths of Astar Network and Soneium, Astar Collective is pioneering a vision of interoperability and accessibility, empowering developers and users alike to unlock Web3’s full potential and bring blockchain technology to billions worldwide. Astar is a Web3 innovation collective!

## What is Astar Network?

*Astar Network* is an interoperable blockchain originating from Japan, serving as the **governance** and **staking layer** within the **Astar Collective**. It provides a secure and scalable multi-VM environment, supporting smart contracts in *WebAssembly* (Wasm) and EVM. Built on a robust architecture and secure by [**Polkadot**](https://polkadot.com/), Astar Network enables interoperability through the **ASTR token**, which connects its ecosystem with multiple interoperable solutions.

## From Blockchain to Collective

![Astar Evolution Phase 1.5](/docs/learn/blockchain_to_collective.jpg)

Astar is currently expanding its ecosystem, aiming to achieve this through the development of [**Soneium**](/docs/learn/soneium/) while prioritizing these two networks as the core layers of its entire ecosystem while leveraging the interoperability within the [**OP Superchain ecosystem**](https://www.superchain.eco/). Soneium is uniquely positioned to bring millions of people on-chain. With a shared vision and aligned goals among core contributors, Soneium is a natural fit for Astar’s ecosystem expansion driven by the **ASTR** token.

> The Next Chapter of Astar: *Three Core Pillars* ⤵️

### 1. Astar Interoperability

Astar Network will be fully connected to Soneium through industry-leading interop solutions such as [**Chainlink CCIP**](https://chain.link/cross-chain), which, in extension, apply to the *Superchain ecosystem*. Through this interoperability, ASTR will be part of today’s most used interconnected network ever built to drive its adoption.

### 2. Astar Token Expansion

The Astar token will play a central place in **Soneium** as an ecosystem token for major consumer applications and payment solutions. Its use will extend beyond Soneium, reaching the broader Superchain ecosystem and leading Ethereum protocols, amplifying its role in driving on-chain utility and broadening adoption.

### 3. Astar Decentralized Governance

Astar is evolving from its centralized roots to embrace *Governance V1*, empowering the community to lead through a decentralized framework.

Through these initiatives, Astar is building momentum to expand the utility of the ASTR token. With Soneium blending web3’s promise with web2’s familiarity, we aim to make dApps and decentralized solutions accessible to everyone, all of which are underpinned by the power of ASTR.

## So, how does Astar Collective work?

**Astar Network** operates as the governance & staking layer, providing a secure and scalable multi-VM environment, while **Soneium**, an advanced L2 solution developed by [**Sony Block Solutions Labs**](https://www.sonynetwork.co.jp/sonynetworkcomlabs/en/), acts as the adoption layer, leveraging Ethereum's OP Stack for high-speed, low-cost transactions tailored to entertainment and consumer applications. The two ecosystems are seamlessly interconnected through the **ASTR token**, which facilitates interoperability via multiple interoperable solutions. 

## What problems does Astar solve?

### 1. Lack of developer incentives

Astar's [**Build2Earn**](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/#build2earn) system is designed to grow the network in an innovative way, while simultaneously rewarding participants and builders. It allows developers to earn incentives for building and maintaining their decentralized applications, and users to earn incentives for supporting their favorite projects, all while encouraging growth of the ecosystem overall.

Moreover, through the *Unstoppable Community Grant program*, project developers can access substantial financial support, allowing them to earn greater rewards and accelerate the growth of their projects more effectively.

### 2. Scalability

Blockchains do not scale by design, mostly due to the security assurances inherent in their decentralized consensus mechanisms. If blockchains were faster, they would be less secure. There is an upper limit to the amount of data that can be stored in individual blocks, and at times of network saturation, users of typical blockchains may notice their transactions sitting unconfirmed or in a pending state for long periods of time, resulting in a poor user experience. 

The solution to the issue, up until now, has been a patchwork of independent blockchains loosely connected by bridges - often subject to attack due to their reliance on custodial elements, with no common security standards or methods of interoperability between all. The idea of 'cross-chain', therefore, has mostly been to copy and paste a smart contract from one blockchain, to another. Projects that create real value are quickly copied and deployed elsewhere for better, or for worse, with almost no real innovation taking place overall.

Astar Network is changing that, and ushering in the next generation of multichain smart contracts uniquely able to utilize the best features from both EVM and WebAssembly Virtual Machines, and any number of application-specific blockchains across the broader Polkadot ecosystem. All while being future-proof.

### 3. Interoperability

This interoperability framework, empowered by the shared security of Polkadot, allows developers to use and build smart contracts in ways they never have before. By fostering cooperation and integrations across multiple blockchains and applications, complex synergies can be developed, leading to the realization of truly innovative solutions that can't be replicated in any other environment.

Many different ecosystems exist, but few have interoperability as their defining feature. Welcome to Astar Collective!
