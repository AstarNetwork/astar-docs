# About Astar Network

[Astar Network]: https://astar.network/

## I. A Web3 Collective

Astar is a web3 collective focused on building products that bring users onchain while creating sustainable value for ASTR holders. Rather than operating as a traditional single-chain ecosystem, Astar coordinates multiple products and contributors across different blockchain networks through a unified economic and governance structure.

At the foundation of this collective sits Astar Network, which serves as the anchor point for governance decisions, security mechanisms, and economic coordination across the entire ecosystem. The network ensures that all activities, whether occurring on Ethereum, Base, or other integrated chains, remain connected to a common framework that benefits the broader Astar community.

## II. The Astar Stack

Central to Astar's vision is the Astar Stack, an integrated product system designed to transform blockchain infrastructure into accessible consumer applications.

Unlike fragmented collections of separate applications, the Astar Stack functions as a unified onchain personal finance platform that makes decentralized finance practical for everyday users. The stack currently features Astar Fi, which serves as the primary hub for saving, earning, and managing digital assets with a user experience comparable to modern financial services, and Astar Guard, which provides continuous risk monitoring and safety alerts to protect users from common web3 pitfalls. These components work together seamlessly, creating an experience where users can participate in onchain finance without needing to understand the underlying technical complexity.

By prioritizing user experience, safety, and sustained engagement over pure technological sophistication, the Astar Stack addresses the fundamental challenge of bringing mainstream users into web3 while generating sustainable economic activity that flows back to the ecosystem.

## III. Economic Alignment

ASTR serves as the economic backbone linking all ecosystem activities together. The token functions both as a governance mechanism that allows community participation in strategic decisions and as an economic instrument that captures value generated across the product ecosystem.

This dual role creates direct alignment between network growth, product success, and token holder interests, ensuring that as Astar's products drive more users onchain, the value created returns to those who contribute to and support the ecosystem's long-term development.
