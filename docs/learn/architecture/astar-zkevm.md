The Astar zkEVM is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum connected to Polygon Aggregation Layer (AggLayer) for shared interoperability. It's a modular Validium blockchain. Smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine also run on Astar zkEVM. The zkEVM boasts the following key features:

- **Lower Transaction Fees compared to Ethereum** - Due to the transaction batching, as explained above.
- **Full EVM-equivalence** - Not only EVM compatibility; Equivalence. Smart contracts that work on Ethereum also work on Astar zkEVM.
- **Native Account Abstraction** - The Astar zkEVM provides native features designed to revolutionize the end-user experience, and make it seamless. 
- **Top-tier Integrations** - Established names and brands that developers trust power the Astar zkEVM. 
- **Interoperability and Exposure** - With Astar zkEVM, we are supporting interoperability between the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems, uniting communities, and empowering web3 accessibility through a common Multichain vision.
- **Established Tools and Libraries** - Compatible with the tools web3 developers already know how to use, such as Remix, Hardhat, and Open Zeppelin.
