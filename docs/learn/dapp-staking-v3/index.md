# dApp Staking

## What is dApp Staking

On the Astar/Shiden Network, developers who build decentralized applications (dApps) have the opportunity to receive compensation through a process known as dApp staking. By engaging in dApp staking, developers can receive a basic income, which allows them to continue building and enhancing their dApps.

dApp staking on the Astar/Shiden Network operates similarly to staking on validators. However, in this new paradigm, individuals known as dApp stakers or nominators have the ability to nominate their Astar/Shiden tokens on specific dApps they wish to support.

At every block on the network, a portion of the rewards is allocated to dApp staking. This reward is then distributed between the operators (developers) of the dApps and the nominators. This mechanism serves as a powerful incentive for developers to build and deploy their dApps on the Astar/Shiden Network.


## Benefits of dApp Staking on Astar/Shiden

For Web3 to flourish, there needs to be a symbiotic relationship between dApp stakers (i.e. nominators), dApp developers, and dApp users. On Astar/Shiden, dApp staking is the mechanism that enables this mutually beneficial relationship to occur.

- Developer Compensation: Unlike traditional approaches where dApp developers need to rely on grant programs, token issuance, and fundraising efforts to generate income, dApp staking on Astar/Shiden provides developers with a basic income. As long as a dApp has been nominated, developers can receive a steady stream of rewards.

- Increased Popularity, Increased Reward: As a dApp gains popularity and attracts more nominators from the community, the developers who built the dApp can receive a larger percentage of the block rewards. This incentivizes developers to create high-quality dApps that resonate with users and foster community engagement.

- Reduced Dependency on Gas Fees: Building on other blockchains often entails paying substantial gas fees for transactions and interactions. However, on the Astar/Shiden Network, developers can receive compensation through dApp staking, minimizing their reliance on gas fees and making it more economically feasible to continue dApp development.

### Benefits for Stakers (Nominators): Increase in Token Value & High APRs

Astar/Shiden dApp stakers (i.e. nominators) want the value of their tokens to increase but for the value of their tokens to increase, the underlying value of the asset — the Astar/Shiden Network — needs to increase.

Another way for the value of tokens to increase is if the total circulation of tokens decreases. The more tokens are staked, the fewer tokens are in circulation, and the fewer tokens are in circulation, the higher the price.

This market dynamic enables dApp stakers to get more long-term value from their tokens while earning high APRs from staking their tokens to dApps.

Please refer to [this section](/docs/use/dapp-staking/for-stakers/) to learn more about participating as a staker.

### Benefits for Builders: Earn Rewards

For great dApps to be built, developers need to build them. For developers to build great dApps, they need financial incentives.

Ultimately, the most precious human resource in the Web3 ecosystem are developers. Before dApp staking, there were little to no financial incentives for developers to make dApps or to build infrastructure in public blockchains.

With dApp staking, developers can earn a basic income while building dApps on Astar/Shiden. Having financial incentives entices more developers to build and improve their dApps. The more developers build on our ecosystem, the better off everyone is.

Please refer to [this section](/docs/use/dapp-staking/for-devs/) to learn more about participating as a dApp builder.

### Benefits for dApp Users: Increase in dApp & Network Utility

For users, dApp staking enables the ecosystem to grow and improve in terms of its utility. This is because better dApps are built as a result of developers having a way to earn money while building them.

Having more (and better) dApps attracts and retains more users, creating a network effect, which helps to grow the ecosystem and increases the long-term intrinsic value of the network.
