Astar is a project that has evolved a lot over time, see here how the Allocation Percentage has changed since its genesis üëáüèº

## Utility

**Astar Token** is the utility token for *Astar Network* that has 3 primary functions:

### 1. dApp Staking

Astar Network's core team has developed a unique concept called **dApp Staking**, which is exclusively available on *Astar* within the *Polkadot ecosystem*. DApp Staking is a simple but effective mechanism. Astar Network's innovative approach allows Astar token holders to show their support for their preferred dApps by staking Astar tokens. By doing so, they not only contribute to the ecosystem's growth but also earn Astar tokens through block rewards. 

Additionally, dApp developers can receive rewards based on the amount staked on their applications.

:::info[UCG program]

As part of Astar Network's commitment to sustainability and decentralization, developers can earn Astar tokens by creating smart contracts or infrastructure for the Astar Network community, making it a robust and decentralized grant mechanism. 

Check out the information about the program here ‚Üí [**Unstoppable Community Grant program**](https://docs.astar.network/docs/use/governance/unstoppable-community-grant-program)

### 2. Transactions

Every on-chain transaction on *Astar Network* requires the sender to send **ASTR** to pay fees. Part of the fee is burned and part is deposited to the collator, so this is a organic model for network growth.

### 3. On-chain Governance

At *Astar Network*, we believe in the power of decentralized decision-making. That's why we're committed to implementing **on-chain governance**, where every member of the community has a say in shaping the network's future. The Astar token plays a crucial role in this process, serving as the primary means for facilitating governance activities such as **voting** and **referenda**. 

## ASTR Utility on Soneium

<Figure caption="ASTR utility on Soneium" src={require('/docs/learn/astr-utility-on-soneium.jpg').default } width="100%" />

**Astar Token** extends its utility beyond Astar Network, becoming a key asset within the *Soneium* ecosystem. ASTR on Soneium has the following functions:

### 1. Payments and Gas Fees

Within the *Soneium* ecosystem, users can utilize **ASTR** to interact with various applications. Several projects have implemented ASTR as their primary token for:

- Paying gas fees for network transactions
- Making purchases in NFT marketplaces
- Interacting with financial applications, games, and consumer apps

This adoption strengthens ASTR's role as a versatile utility token within the Soneium ecosystem.

### 2. Liquidity Provision

ASTR functions as a fundamental asset for liquidity provision in *Soneium*:

- Facilitates efficient exchanges between ecosystem tokens
- Allows users to provide liquidity and participate in ecosystem growth
- Creates a bidirectional value flow between Astar Network and Soneium

### 3. Superchain Expansion

As part of the *Astar Collective* strategy, ASTR positions itself as one of the first tokens to integrate into the *Superchain* through Soneium:

- Establishes foundations for cross-chain operations
- Expands the token's reach and utility in a broader blockchain ecosystem
- Drives interoperability and value creation across networks

:::info[ACS campaign]

The ACS campaign is an effort by the Astar Foundation to highlight the usability and value of the ASTR token within the Soneium ecosystem. You can read more about the [**ACS Campaign**](https://astar.network/blog/astar-contribution-score-acs-fueling-astr-s-next-growth-phase-171) here.

## Shiden and Shibuya

Both **Shiden** and **Shibuya** have their own tokens. *Shiden's* token is **SDN**. *Shibuya's* token is **SBY**. 

:::info[Get SBY tokens]

There are ways to get SBY for testing purposes. Check it out here ‚Üí [**Get SBY tokens**](/docs/build/environment/faucet.md).
