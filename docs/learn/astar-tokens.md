# Astar Token

## Overview

The native token of Astar Network is **Astar** Token, with the ticker **ASTR**. The initial supply of ASTR was *7,000,000,000* units.  The current tokenomics model of the network is inflationary and the inflation is estimated to be *~665,000,000 yearly*. ASTR token has *18 decimals*. 

At the genesis, ASTR were allocated as follows: 

| Allocation | % |

|Users and Early Supporters| 30|
|Parachain Auction in 2021 | 20 |
| Parachain Auctions Reserve | 5|
| Protocol Development | 10 |
|On-Chain DAO| 5|
|Marketing | 5 |
| Early Financial Backers | 10 |

## Utility

Astar Token is the utility token for Astar Network that has 3 primary functions:

### 1. dApp Staking

Astar Network's core team has developed a unique concept called **dApp Staking**, which is exclusively available on *Astar* within the *Polkadot ecosystem*. The goal of Astar Network is to establish itself as the primary hub for decentralized and interoperable applications (dApps) on Polkadot and Ethereum. Hence we prepared incentives for dApp developers who choose to build their smart contracts on Astar.

dApp Staking is a simple but effective mechanism. Astar Network's innovative approach allows Astar token holders to show their support for their preferred dApps by staking Astar tokens. By doing so, they not only contribute to the ecosystem's growth but also earn Astar tokens through block rewards. Additionally, dApp developers can receive rewards based on the amount staked on their applications.

As part of Astar Network's commitment to sustainability and decentralization, developers can earn Astar tokens by creating smart contracts or infrastructure for the Astar Network community, making it a robust and decentralized grant mechanism.

### 2. Transactions

Every on-chain transaction on Astar Network requires the sender to send ASTR to pay fees. Part of the fee is burned and part is deposited to the collator, so this is a organic model for network growth.

### 3. On-chain Governance

At Astar Network, we believe in the power of decentralized decision-making. That's why we're committed to implementing **on-chain governance**, where every member of the community has a say in shaping the network's future. The Astar token plays a crucial role in this process, serving as the primary means for facilitating governance activities such as **voting** and **referenda**. 

## Shiden and Shibuya

Both **Shiden** and **Shibuya** have their own tokens. *Shiden's* token is **SDN**. *Shibuya's* token is **SBY**.

There are ways to get SBY for testing purposes. Check it out here → [**Get SBY tokens**](/docs/build/environment/faucet.md).
