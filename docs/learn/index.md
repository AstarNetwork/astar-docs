# Learn

Greetings! Welcome to the educational section of the Astar Docs.

This section introduces the fundamentals of the Astar Collective and its multi-chain ecosystem, designed to bring users onchain and generate long-term value for ASTR. Whether you are new to blockchain or exploring the Astar ecosystem as a developer, these resources provide essential knowledge about how Astar Network operates as the foundation for governance, security, and economic alignment.

To deepen your understanding of building applications, integrating tools, or developing within the ecosystem, we recommend exploring the [**Build**](/docs/build) section.
