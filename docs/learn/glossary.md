# Glossary

 ### Archive node 
  A node that stores all historical states of a blockchain between blocks.

 ### ASTR
 The native token of Astar. Used for dApp staking.

 ### Ask!
 An embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for writing smart contracts based on AssemblyScript.

 ### Bridge 
 A mechanism that allows the transfer of assets or data between two different blockchain networks.

 ### Collator
  A node that maintains a parachain by collecting parachain transactions and producing state transition proofs for the validators.

 ### Cross-chain
 Ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data or assets with each other, allowing for interoperability and enhancing the functionality and scalability of blockchain ecosystems.

 ### DAO
 Short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a blockchain-based organization that allows for decentralized decision-making and management by its members.

 ### DApp
 A generic term for a decentralized application, that is, one that runs as part of a distributed network as opposed to being run on a specific system or set of systems.

 ### EVM
 short for Ethereum Virtual Machine.  A software environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum compatible blockchain networks.

 ### H160
 An Ethereum format address for Substrate-based blockchains.

 ### HRMP
 Short for Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing. A precursor to the complete XCMP implementation, that mimics the same interface and semantics of XCMP.  The plan is to retire HRMP once the implementation of XCMP is complete.

 ### Ink!
 An embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for writing smart contracts based on Rust.

 ### Layer 1
  The underlying infrastructure of a blockchain network, which includes the block production mechanism, the data structure, and the rules for validating transactions.

 ### Layer 2
 Programs built on top of layer 1 such as smart contracts or solutions to improve scalability, reduce transaction costs, and enhance the functionality of the blockchain network.

 ### Light client
 A client that does not download the full blockchain, and instead downloads only block headers. Connects to full nodes to query data.

 ### Mainnet
 Short for "main network": the fully functional production chain that runs its own network.

 ### Node
 A device connected to a blockchain network that stores a copy of the blockchain ledger and participates in validating transactions and maintaining the network's security and integrity.

 ### Pallet
 A Substrate runtime module.

 ### Parachain 
 A blockchain that meets several characteristics that allow it to work within the confines of the Polkadot Host. Also known as “parallelized chain”.

 ### Polakdot
 A heterogeneous, multi-chain network allowing various blockchains of different characteristics to perform arbitrary, cross-chain communication under shared security.

 ### Relayer
 A node that relays messages between different chains in Polkadot.

 ### Rollup
 A scaling solution that bundles multiple transactions into a single transaction to increase throughput and reduce fees on a network.

 ### Sharding
 Partition of a blockchain network that allows for parallel processing of transactions to increase scalability and network capacity.

 ### Shiden
 The "canary network" for Astar connected to Kusama, a canary network for Polkadot. It consists of an early-release, unaudited version of the Astar codebase. It is not a testnet.

 ### Shibuya
 A testnet for Shiden and Astar.

 ### Smart Contract
 A self-executing computer program that automatically enforces and executes the terms of an agreement between parties on a blockchain network.

 ### SS58 
 Standardized format for encoding and decoding account addresses. It stands for Substrate 58, where 58 refers to the base-58 encoding scheme used to encode the address and is used to represent user accounts and public keys in Substrate-based blockchains.

 ### Staking
 Allocating tokens to a process with defined objective (e.g. security, elections etc.) and earn rewards on the network. In Astar used to nominate dApps to provide basic income to developers.

 ### Substrate 
 A modular framework for building blockchains. Astar is built with Substrate.

 ### Swanky Suite 
 A suite of tools for building Wasm smart contracts on Astar that simplifly compilation, deployment and testing.

 ### Testnet 
 Short for "test network": an experimental network where testing and development takes place. Networks are often executed on a testnet before they are deployed to a mainnet.

 ### Vesting
 A mechanism where a certain amount of tokens is released to the owner gradually over a period of time, often used for incentivizing long-term commitments and discouraging short-term speculation.

 ### Wallet 
 A program that allows one to store private keys and sign transactions for Astar or other blockchain networks.

 ### Wasm

 Also WebAssembly, a language-agnostic, binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.

 ### XC-20
 A standard for cross-chain assets in Polkadot ecosystem with ERC-20 interface.

 ### XCM 
 Short for Cross-Consensus Messaging, a **messaging format**  and language used to communicate between consensus systems.

 ### XVM
  Short for Cross Virtual Machine, a pallet that provides interfaces for smart contracts that run on different virtual machines to interact with each other.

 ### Zero-knowledge proof
 A cryptographic protocol that allows one party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.
 
### Zombienet
A CLI tool to easily spawn ephemeral Substrate-based networks and perform tests against them.
