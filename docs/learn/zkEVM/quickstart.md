# Overview of Astar zkEVM

Astar zkEVM is Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum offering a blazing fast and more cost-effective experience compared to Ethereum itself. Coupled with support from Polygon, it's the first network to plug into the Aggregation Layer (AggLayer) and harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs to move transaction execution and data availability off-chain, while continuing to operate under the same security umbrella as Ethereum.

## Connecting to Astar zkEVM

To add **Astar zkEVM** to your wallet manually, enter the following details :

| RPC URL | ChainID | Block Explorer URL | Currency |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| `https://rpc.startale.com/astar-zkevm` | `3776` | [https://astar-zkevm.explorer.startale.com/](https://astar-zkevm.explorer.startale.com/) | **ETH** |
| `https://astar-zkevm-rpc.dwellir.com` | `3776` | | **ETH** |


To add the network to MetaMask you can either use the data above, or find a link to add the network at the bottom of the respective block explorer page.

## Bridging Assets

The next step is to bridge funds to the Astar zkEVM. You can use the Astar official [zkEVM Bridge](https://portal.astar.network/astar/bridge) if you already have funds on Astar Network.

:::important
Astar official [zkEVM Bridge](https://portal.astar.network/astar/bridge) does not inherit any counterparty risk compared to 3rd party bridge services, so is therefore trustless.
