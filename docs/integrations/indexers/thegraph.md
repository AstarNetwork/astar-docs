# The Graph

[The Graph]: https://thegraph.com/en/

## Overview: Why is The Graph needed?

[The Graph] is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains. It makes querying fast, reliable and secure but also allows anyone to build and publish application programming interfaces (APIs) called subgraphs, which act as intermediaries and allow applications to communicate with one other.

## Prerequisites

Before you run The Graph node on a server, you will need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Containerization platform for software solutions.
- [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) : Used to automate interactions between docker containers.
- [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/): JSON processor for graph requests.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to run an Astar node for getting more insight into the transactions on the blockchain, by providing indexing data to The Graph node.

## Running a Graph Node

After successfully running an [RPC node](https://docs.astar.network/docs/nodes/archive-node/), the Graph node will need to be installed and configured to connect to a separate computer. If you are running a self-signed RPC node, you will need to set up an extra environment variable for allowance.

The first step is to clone the [Graph Node repository](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/):

```sh
git clone <https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/> \\
&& cd graph-node/docker
```

Next, execute the `setup.sh` file. This will pull all the necessary Docker images and write the necessary information to the `docker-compose.yml` file. Do ensure that `docker-compose` and `jq` are installed.

```sh
sudo bash ./setup.sh
```

After running the command, the tail end of the command should show similar logs as below:

Once everything is set up, you will need to modify the "Ethereum environment" inside the `docker-compose.yml` file, so that the Graph node points to the endpoint of the RPC that you are connecting with. Note that the `setup.sh` file detects the RPC's Host IP and writes its value, so you'll need to modify it accordingly.

## Modifying the Ethereum Environment

### Astar

```sh
# open docker-compose.yml
nano docker-compose.yml

# modify file and save
ethereum: 'astar:https://<IP address or domain>:<PORT>'
```

### Shiden

```sh
# open docker-compose.yml
nano docker-compose.yml

# modify file and save
ethereum: 'shiden:https://<IP address or domain>:<PORT>'
```

### Shibuya

```sh
# open docker-compose.yml
nano docker-compose.yml

# modify file and save
ethereum: 'shibuya:https://<IP address or domain>:<PORT>'
```

For example, if you are building a Graph node for Shiden, the entire `docker-compose.yml` now should appear as below:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  graph-node:
    image: graphprotocol/graph-node
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
      - '8001:8001'
      - '8020:8020'
      - '8030:8030'
      - '8040:8040'
    depends_on:
      - ipfs
      - postgres
    environment:
      postgres_host: postgres
      postgres_user: graph-node
      postgres_pass: let-me-in
      postgres_db: graph-node
      ipfs: 'ipfs:5001'
      ethereum: 'shiden:https://<IP address or DOMAIN>:<PORT>'
      RUST_LOG: info
  ipfs:
    image: ipfs/go-ipfs:v0.4.23
    ports:
      - '5001:5001'
    volumes:
      - ./data/ipfs:/data/ipfs
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    command: ["postgres", "-cshared_preload_libraries=pg_stat_statements"]
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: graph-node
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: let-me-in
      POSTGRES_DB: graph-node
    volumes:
      - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

## Running The Graph containers

Run the following command:

```sh
sudo docker-compose up
```

When everything is set up the log will appear as below:
