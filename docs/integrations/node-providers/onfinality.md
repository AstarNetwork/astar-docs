# OnFinality

## Overview

[OnFinality] is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot community. Its mission is to support blockchain developers of all shapes and sizes by providing infrastructure services so they can focus on building the next dApp.

OnFinality provides an API service for the Astar ecosystem and is now live on all our networks. The initial deployment of the integration of OnFinality allows users to:

- Query our network RPC and WSS endpoints immediately using OnFinalityâ€™s free API service. You can create a free account key for 500k daily requests to high-performance managed nodes, including ones for Polkadot and Kusama.
- Quickly stand up dedicated nodes to have private access to high-performance WSS and RPC APIs without needing to manage your own infrastructure.

## Instructions

To create a custom OnFinality endpoint, go to [OnFinality] and sign up, or if you already have signed up you can go ahead and log in. From the **OnFinality Dashboard**, you can:

1. Click on API Service
2. Select the network from the dropdown
3. Your custom API endpoint will be generated automatically
