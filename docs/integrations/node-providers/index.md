# Node Providers
 
The free endpoints mentioned in the [Quickstart section](../../quickstart/) are rate limited and dedicated to end users to be used to interact with dapps or deploy/call smart contracts. Thus, they are not suitable for usage by a dapp UI scraping blockchain data constantly or an indexer (like the Graph).


Please create your own endpoint for development or production referring to the [Run an archive node](/docs/nodes/archive-node/) section or get own API key for free/paid tier from one of our infra providers listed below:


```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
