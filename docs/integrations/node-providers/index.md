# Node Providers
 
The free endpoints mentioned in the [Quickstart section](../../quickstart/) are rate limited and designed for end users to be used to interact with dApps, or deploy/call smart contracts. They are not suitable for usage by dApp UIs that scrape blockchain data continuously, or indexers (like the Graph).


Please create your own endpoint for development or production, referring to the how to [run an archive node](/docs/nodes/archive-node/) section, or get your own API key for a free/paid tier from one of our infra providers listed below:


```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
