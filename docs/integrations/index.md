# Integrations

Here you will find some common services available to developers building dApps on Astar/Shiden, including sample configurations, and guides for many important elements of our infrastructure, including:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
