# CODEOWNERS

This is a file that helps manage who can approve Pull Requests (PRs) depending on the content (main documentation and site configuration vs. i18n translations).

## i18n in the Docusaurus file structure

The file structure related to internationalization in Docusaurus follows the logic below:

* To add a new language (a one-time action, part of the first PR when enabling an additional language), you must edit the configuration in: `/docusaurus.config.ts`

* To add or modify translations for an already enabled language, ownership of the `/i18n/*` folder is sufficient.

## PR no related to i18n folder

For Any PR related to anything outside of `/i18n` folder requires an approval by someone from **@AstarNetwork/documentation** â†’ [**Source**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging).
