# For Stakers

## Overview

Do you love to stake? Or do you want to support your favorite project by staking on their dApp? You can educate yourself by reading the documentation carefully. In case you have any questions, come and join our Discord channel.

Please take the following parameters into consideration:

- The **minimum** amount to stake for users is **50 SDN or 500 ASTR.**
- **You need to claim to receive your rewards, we recommend claiming for your staking rewards once a week.**
- There is a bonding period for around 5 days on Shiden and 10 days on Astar. Please note that this is based on a perfect block production of 12s. In case of any delay, your unbonding period can be a little longer.
