# Collator Requirements

## How to become a collator

### Permissionless collator

To become a permissionless collator on our networks, you need to meet below requirements.

**Collator staking requirements**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="astar" label="Astar Network" default>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Bond: 3,200,000 ASTR tokens (3.2M $ASTR)</li>
  <li>Meet hardware requirements</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If your node stops producing blocks for 1 session, your node will be kicked out of the active set and 1% of the bonded funds will be slashed. Running a node with low performance can lead to skipping blocks which can lead to being kicked out of the active set.</p>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="shiden" label="Shiden Network">
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Bond: 32,000 SDN tokens (32k $SDN)</li>
  <li>Meet hardware requirements</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If your node stops producing blocks for 1 session, your node will be kicked out of the active set and 1% of the bonded funds will be slashed. Running a node with low performance can lead to skipping blocks which can lead to being kicked out of the active set.</p>

Set your collator with:
**Extrinsics - CollatorSelection - Register as candidate** |
Onboarding takes **n+1** session.

### System requirements

A collator usually deploys its nodes on cloud servers. You can choose your preferred operating system, we highly recommend Linux.

**Hardware requirements**

Here you can find the basic configuration for reference, which guarantees that all blocks can process in time. If the hardware is inferior to that, there is a chance it will be malfunctioning and you will be automatically kicked out from the active set.

:::note
Make sure your server is only dedicated to the collator node

Shibuya is the perfect network to test out your knowledge about running nodes in the Astar ecosystem. To join the collator set on Shibuya you need to apply for a 32k SBY fund.
If you never operated a collator node, we strongly encourage you to spin up a **Shibuya collator** node to start before thinking about mainnet. A perfect start is our [secure setup guide](/docs/nodes/collator/secure_setup_guide/).
