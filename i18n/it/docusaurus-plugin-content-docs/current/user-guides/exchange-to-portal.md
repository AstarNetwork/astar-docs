# Sending ASTR/SDN from exchanges to our portal

Currently, $ASTR and $SDN are listed on tier 1 exchanges. One of the FAQs from our community is how to withdraw the token from exchanges.

First, [create a new wallet](create-wallet.md) or [a new multisig wallet](create-multisig.md) and withdraw some tokens to it.

## Use Astar Native address

[Discord]: https://discord.gg/uNUN9Vxak2

Astar supports both Polkadot native virtual machine and Ethereum virtual machine. Therefore, Astar has 2 different addresses. We are trying to make our user experience as easy as possible. If you have any feedback, please send us on [Discord].

[Astar portal]: https://portal.astar.network/#/balance/wallet

Please go to the [Astar portal] and connect your Polkadot.js. If you haven't installed Polkadot.js, please do install from [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).
