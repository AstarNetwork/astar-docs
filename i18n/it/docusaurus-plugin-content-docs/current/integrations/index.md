# Integrations

Integrations shares common services available while building a dApp on Astar/Shiden. It includes configurations and how-tos for many important infrastructure pieces, and includes:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
