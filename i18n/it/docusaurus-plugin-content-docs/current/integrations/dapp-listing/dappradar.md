## Introduction to DappRadar

[DappRadar] was started in 2018 with the goal of delivering high quality, accurate insights on decentralized applications to a global audience and rapidly became the go-to, trusted industry source. Since then, DappRadar has become a defacto standard for DApp discovery with more than ten thousand applications listed over twenty protocols. In their own words, *“Across the globe consumers are discovering dapps and managing their NFT/DeFi portfolios with  . We’re visited by over 500,000 users every month, our data powers leading industry partners and our quarterly reports are the trusted authority on multichain dapp market insight*.”
