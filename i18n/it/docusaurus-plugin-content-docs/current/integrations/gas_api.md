# Gas Price API

## Overview

Gas is the unit of measure for how much computational work is required to process transactions and smart contracts. Essentially a transaction fee, the term originates from Ethereum, in which context it refers to computation undertaken on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Since Ethereum was founded, numerous EVM-compatible networks have emerged and adopted similar models.

The term can be considered analogous to the gas that powers a car engine: it's the fluctuating, occasionally expensive cost of operation. More complex smart contracts require more gas to power their computation, just as a bigger, more powerful car takes more gas to run.

Gas price api is a service that allows you to get the various gas prices of the astar network for various transaction times. Gas fee are provided in wei.

## Response parameters

- slow: The gas price for a transaction that takes a long time to execute.
- average: The gas price for a transaction that takes a medium time to execute.
- fast: The gas price for a transaction that takes a short time to execute.

- eip1559:

With EIP1559 transactions gas fee are divided in two parts: base fee and priority fee.

The Base Fee, which is determined by the network itself. And is same for a block.
Priority Fee, which is optional, determined by the user, is a tip to validators, and incentivizes them to prioritize your transaction.

EIP-1559's purpose is essentially to make gas fees more transparent and predictable for users. Previously, to have your transaction processed, you essentially had to 'bid' with a high enough total fee to make sure the miner was incentivized to pick up your transaction reasonably soon. This meant the market price was constantly moving according to demand.

- priorityFeePerGas: The variable part of the gas fee. Determined by the user.
- baseFeePerGas: The fixed part of the gas fee. Determined by the network.
